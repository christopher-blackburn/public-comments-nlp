                                        UNITED STATES               SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION         WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549      OFFICE OF THE          INVESTOR ADVOCATE            February 9, 2021   Via Email to: Evidence@bea.gov   Lucas Hitt  Designated Federal Official  Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building  4600 Silver Hill Road  Washington, DC 20233   RE:  Comments for the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building  Docket Number EAB-2021-0001   Dear Committee Members:1    Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments in regard to the Request for Comments for  the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building. While the SEC is not a Chief Financial  Officers Act agency and thus is not required to follow Title I of the Foundations for Evidence-Based  Policymaking Act (Evidence Act), we hope our insights about evidence generation and organizational  structures will be informative to other agencies and overall policy.   The Office of the Investor Advocate (OIAD) at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act) with a mission to protect and advocate for investors, and a mandate to conduct research in  support of that purpose.2 In 2017, we launched one of the most comprehensive evidence generation  programs in government, the POSITIER3 investor testing initiative. Over the past several years, our  achievements have been enormous, and we have greatly advanced the cause of evidence building in our  agency and the greater policy community. Nevertheless, we do still face headwinds that inhibit our  ability to use our tools to the fullest within our agency. We discuss these at length in our most recent  semi-annual report to Congress—the Office of the Investor Advocate’s Report on Activities for Fiscal                                                   1 The Securities and Exchange Commission disclaims responsibility for any private publication or statement of any SEC employee or Commissioner. The views expressed herein are our own and do not reflect those of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff. 2 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 4(g)(4), 15 U.S.C. § 78d(g)(4), states: ‘‘(4) FUNCTIONS OF THE INVESTOR ADVOCATE.—The Investor Advocate shall— ‘‘(A) assist retail investors in resolving significant problems such investors may have with the Commission or with self-regulatory organizations; ‘‘(B) identify areas in which investors would benefit from changes in the regulations of the Commission or the rules of self-regulatory organizations; ‘‘(C) identify problems that investors have with financial service providers and investment products; ‘‘(D) analyze the potential impact on investors of— ‘‘(i) proposed regulations of the Commission; and ‘‘(ii) proposed rules of self-regulatory organizations registered under this title; and ‘‘(E) to the extent practicable, propose to the Commission changes in the regulations or orders of the Commission and to Congress any legislative, administrative, or personnel changes that may be appropriate to mitigate problems identified under this paragraph and to promote the interests of investors.” 3 The name POSITIER is an acronym for Policy Oriented Stakeholder and Investor Testing for Innovative and Effective Regulation.     Year 2020,4 pages 12-15 and 51-65—which we are submitting with this letter. We provide below  highlights, including a recommendation for process reforms within the SEC, and additional perspective.   As the community associated with the Evidence Act is not normally a target audience for that report, we  wish to draw the report your attention.   Specifically, this comment letter responds to the following questions from the “Request for  Comments for the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building”5:   “1. What are the main challenges faced by national, state/provincial, or local governments that are  trying to build a basis for evidence-based policy? Briefly describe the bottlenecks and pain-points  they face in the evidence-based decision-making process.”   And    “3.   Which frameworks, policies, practices, or methods show promise in overcoming challenges  experienced by governments in their evidence building?”   I. The SEC in the Context of the Evidence Act   OIAD has consistently been a strong advocate for the use of evidence within our agency, and we  have encouraged our agency to adopt parts of the Evidence Act that are required only of Chief Financial  Officers Act agencies.6 Our design of POSITIER attempted to provide a set of rapidly deployable and  cost effective research tools that greatly expanded the potential for using evidence for policy, while  providing instruments to allow greater public engagement with the policy development process. Our  toolkit was not designed simply to respond to immediate requirements for use of evidence, but rather  more broadly to anticipate future needs so that it would be rapidly deployable when opportunities arose,  and scalable when more resources became available. In fact, POSITIER was designed after reviewing  practices across a wide range of agencies.    We view the tools of POSITIER as useful not only for investor research and investor protection,  but also as instruments for better overall management and effectiveness of the agency as a whole. By  design, POSITIER actively aimed to build an infrastructure that would enable OIAD and the  Commission to respond to the Evidence Act and other directives and executive orders that have  attempted to advance the cause of evidence building over the past decade.7                                                    4 See SEC, Office of the Investor Advocate, Report on Activities for Fiscal Year 2020 (Dec. 29, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-investor-advocate-report-on-activities-2020.pdf (“2020 Report on Activities”). 5 Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, Department of Commerce, Request for Comments for the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building, 85 Fed.

II. POSITIER Accomplishments 2017-2020  POSITIER is a household finance and behavioral research program that provides a  comprehensive infrastructure for the collection and analysis of experimental, survey, administrative, and  other data. Since our first data collection in June 2017, POSITIER has conducted 24 high quality,  nationally representative, probability-based surveys (all but 6 using unique survey instruments), several  dozen experiments, five non-probability research studies, and nine qualitative studies. It has been  estimated that we have reduced the government’s typical data collection lifecycle by over 95%,8 and we  have fielded tests that cost considerably less than many larger scale research projects. By reducing costs  and timeframes, we have endeavored to eliminate the excuse that research takes too long and costs too  much. Rather than a primarily outsourced model, we aim to focus on continued development of  expertise inside the agency so that OIAD builds internal capacity and knowledge to deploy for the  complex and specialized problems that we face in promoting a healthy environment for investors. This  work is urgent because many of our constituents depend on investments for retirement and other life  goals even if they have limited means and limited investment expertise. POSITIER provides the tools  for us to fulfill our mission to conduct research on the problems investors face and examine the impacts  of proposed rulemakings on investors.    III.  Obstacles to Investor Testing  While our semi-annual report to Congress provides details specific to our program, we would  like to highlight and reference some obstacles discussed in that report.9 Many of these themes will be  readily apparent to the evidence community, but we believe they are worth outlining for the purpose of  this comment letter.    Evidence professionals and researchers often face strong cultural and institutional headwinds within their organizations (page 57). Integrating evidence often requires overcoming decades of  non-evidence based practice, along with accompanying policies, procedures, and customs specific to  an agency’s established way of operating.    Evidence programs require adequate resources and conditions for success (page 55) – In our case, the lack of adequate staffing has at times resulted in bottlenecks because we have a need to  stretch our human resources over far more stages of the production process than is optimal.    Some testing tools are still regarded with skepticism (page 63) – Government agencies need to find ways to overcome their naturally risk-averse tendencies in order to make innovation and  evidence programs successful. Agencies need leadership to help carve out institutional space for  evidence generation, but may also need legal and institutional changes to create a safe space for  evidence generation. Ultimately, we look forward to a time when staff colleagues focus on the  question of: “how do we make this happen?” rather than “what are all the reasons why this shouldn’t  happen?” One particular area that is often regarded as sensitive in our agency is the use of field  experiments. We view field tests as essential to answering some of the research questions within our  purview because in lab-style settings it is often difficult to create incentives that align with  incentives in the real world. We acknowledge the sensitivities involved in such research and the need  for caution, but also note that it may simply be that new approaches are often viewed skeptically.  Concerns about the use of new methods (new to the agency, not to the research community) need to                                                   8 See SEC, Office of the Investor Advocate, Report on Activities for the Fiscal Year 2018 (Dec. 20, 2018), https://www.sec.gov/advocate/reportspubs/annual-reports/sec-investor-advocate-report-on-activities-2018.pdf.  9 See, e.g., 2020 Report on Activities, supra note 4, at 55-57.    be appropriately balanced against the consequences of adopting ineffective or harmful policies  without appropriate evidence.     IV. Proposal: A Step-By-Step Process for Evidence Generation  Our report suggests a process revamp for SEC rulemaking that would integrate social scientists  earlier into policy development and, where applicable, make investor testing a routine part of the  development process (pages 57-64). One concern is that in the SEC, social scientists and evidence  experts are typically not fully integrated into policy development until the policy is almost final.   Our proposal for a reformed policy development process contains seven steps: problem  identification, outcomes identification, refinement of outcomes measurability, development of a theory  of change, iteration as needed to refine the theory of change, testing and evidence building, iteration  again as needed through the entire testing and theory of change process, and publication of the results.  We sketch out this process in our report in order to reinforce important steps along the way, while also  highlighting the need for iteration in the learning process. Our proposal emphasizes the need for a  different approach to policymaking that integrates social scientists into the policymaking process at  early stages so that appropriate policy solutions can be identified early and vetted properly.   Development of the Theory of Change is truly the centerpiece of our proposed process. Too  often, policy proposals focus on a proposed activity, rather than on a causal chain that links activities to  outcomes using existing empirical and theoretical knowledge gleaned from relevant scientific  disciplines. Moreover, to the extent that some theory of change exists, it may have been constructed by  focusing first on the activities themselves. Instead, we articulate a process that puts the emphasis on  starting with desired outcomes and working backwards within the causal pathway to identify potential  activities that might support those outcomes. When one focuses on outcomes, a causal chain naturally  leads to the development of potential alternative policies for which testing can yield insights and provide  the basis for determining the most effective policy. In contrast, when one focuses on a particular activity  as the starting point—for example, a new disclosure—testing is immediately circumscribed to a  narrower range of questions.   Taking things a step further than our report, we would argue that—at best—this narrower range  of questions may lead to optimizing the value of the specified activity (e.g. finding the best disclosure),  rather than identifying and evaluating potential alternative activities (e.g. finding the best among policy  options). From a policy perspective, this can lead to an optimized activity that is not particularly  effective overall at promoting the outcomes of interest. At the same time, there are issues from an  evidence generation perspective: an activity-focused theory of change can lead to what might be  described as “dead end” testing—a set of test results that demonstrates no effects of the proposed  activity, but also does not provide insights as to other potential policy paths to pursue. In effect, it can  lead to a frustrating set of null results that ultimately does not lead to better policy. We would argue that  one of the biggest reasons for failure and frustration in evidence environments is a failure to develop a  clear theory of change that provides the basis for guiding testing. We also believe that a theory of  change is essential for proper articulation of a policy even if testing is not feasible.    V. Additional Considerations  We recognize that getting policy right is hard. While not every policy is conducive to rigorous  evidence-based approaches, we believe that the evidence agenda is not close to a point of diminishing  returns. Some additional issues that merit consideration:      Independence is essential (page 57) – OIAD is fortunate it was created under the Dodd-Frank Act as an independent office. We have found this independence to be critical to maintaining the integrity  of our research, but recognize that such independence is not universally available to other evidence  programs.     OIAD’s Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Exemption – Our research activities operate under a PRA exemption specified in the Dodd-Frank Act. It is true that this helps expedite our research  process considerably, but the design of our POSITIER infrastructure and the independence of OIAD  are as equally consequential to rapid deployment as the PRA exemption. At the same time, our work  relies heavily on statistical sampling using national probability-based sampling frames with  individuals that have pre-committed to participate in study groups. We have been extremely cautious  in our approach to study participants and submit all of our research to an Institutional Review Board  and undertake other measures before any data collection takes place. While the PRA is often  lamented inside of agencies because of massive restrictions on routine data collection, we encourage  caution with respect to removing restrictions entirely. We have some fear of agencies without  adequate research capacities sending surveys without adequate precautions, further intensifying  already notable non-response issues with survey data collection. Note that agencies that have strong  administrative data infrastructure may already have adequate tools to conduct data analysis without  the need to trigger PRA review.    Use of administrative data – While we have devoted attention to developing and integrating administrative data assets on investors as part of our research endeavors, these efforts have not yet  borne fruit. We ultimately view this data as complementary or superior in many instances to the  survey data upon which we rely because it can be arrived at with less intrusion and can be more  accurate in many circumstances. Yet, at least partly because the SEC does not implement programs,  the SEC does not have access to very much in the way of investor-related administrative datasets  that are useful for attribution studies of the type that are consistent with our research agenda. Several  internal datasets constructed by the regulatory community for enforcement and related purposes face  huge operational, access, and other challenges in terms of using them for research purposes— particularly for the public-facing research to which OIAD is committed. We continue to seek out  ways to integrate administrative data assets into our work, but have found this to be challenging.   Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments related to the Evidence Act. We welcome  any follow up engagement or assistance we can provide to promote and facilitate your important work.
