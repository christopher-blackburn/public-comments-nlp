 Comments for the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building  David W. Archer, PhD​1​    Rawane Issa​1,​2​    Rebecca N. Wright, PhD​3  09 February 2021  We are pleased to respond to the ​Request for Comments for the Advisory Committee on Data                for Evidence Building​. Our perspective on sharing Government data for making evidence-based            decisions is that of technology researchers and providers, and privacy advocates. To that end,              we restrict our comments to only three of the questions posed in the Request. We offer these                 comments without advocacy for specific technologies, products, or services. We feel that            sharing data while respecting the privacy of the subjects of that data and the confidentiality               sometimes required in governance is a much broader challenge than can be addressed by              pushing for specific commercial solutions.

We offer these ideas and viewpoints as               private persons with expertise and interest in privacy and technologies that enable privacy.  4. The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (See: ​www.cep.gov​) recommended the          creation of a National Secure Data Service (See Commission Report at ​www.cep.gov​). Do you              agree with this recommendation, and if so, what should be the essential features of a National                Secure Data Service?  We agree that a National Secure Data Service is critical to the successful preservation of data                confidentiality and the concomitant efficient and effective sharing of that data. However, we             caution that our view of how NSDS should be structured and what its key contributions should                be may be different than early, popular interpretations held by some advocates. Specifically, we              believe that  ● Standards for data interoperability are critical. NSDS should have strong, clear           standards for data cleaning, schema documentation, and suitability for use specification           prior to accepting data ​from data providers. Regarding data cleaning, we note that             parties using data are seldom equipped to clean that data, impute missing fields, or              check the data for exceptional or out-of-range entries. Regarding schema          documentation, we note that parties receiving data often lack an understanding of the             data’s ​semantics​, and thus may be unable to correctly utilize the data to achieve the               intended semantics of analytic results they produce. Regarding suitability for use, we             1 ​Galois, Inc. 2 ​Boston University 3 ​Barnard College    note that data analytics often fail to produce applicable results because analysts may not              understand the applicability of data to their analysis. Providers should be required to             document assumptions, constraints, and other factors that inform prospective users          about when and how their data can be applied.  ● A central “data fortress” is a risk-laden idea. NSDS should not be organized as a               “secure facility perimeter”, whether virtual or physical, where authorized users go to            access data and perform computation. Perimeter-focused security has a long          demonstrated history of being insecure in practice. Instead, data should be held - and              “loaned out” for use - by data providers, with true end-to-end protection at rest, in transit,                and during computation via strong cryptographic protocols. Prospective users -          borrowers - of data should be required to prove to a provider’s satisfaction that they can                protect the data they borrow in a provable, cryptographic way. The role of the NSDS thus                becomes one of a ​data catalog​, documenting data availability, connecting users to            providers, and attesting to the authorization of each to transact the borrowing and             loaning of data.  ● A central “big compute farm” is an unscalable idea​. NSDS should be decentralized             from the computation power point of view. Centralized computation will not scale, and is              typically hard to use because data users must learn new practices and procedures that              distract from doing the business of analysis. Instead, NSDS should let the (appropriately             protected) data flow to where computation can be done in familiar and scalable settings.  ● Contractual trust is not enough. NSDS should require that access to data be based on               proven, attested technical security measures, in addition to contractual agreements to           keep data secure. We note that contractual agreements play an important role, but             provide no protection against insider threats or external compromise, which constitute           the majority of data mis-use. In addition, contractual agreements provide only ​ex post             facto protections in legal settings, and typically provide no relief to individuals whose             personal data may be compromised.   ● Privacy Tech advocacy is key​. NSDS must be ​forward-looking​, seeking to be not only              a national asset for cataloguing and controlling access to data, but also a national asset               for transitioning nascent, proven data privacy technologies into mainstream use.  ● Access control policies should include intended use. NSDS should establish          policies about who may access data. While such access should naturally include            attributes of the individuals using the data, the organizations for whom they work, and              even at times the nationalities of those organizations (especially in the case of sensitive              national information assets), access should also be mediated by the ​intended use and             distribution of the results of analysis to be performed. It may be that diverse ​editions ​of                data should be made available, offering more or less content based on that intended              use.   ● Time is of the essence of access​. In addition, NSDS should establish policies that              require access to data be provably time-bounded: data must be permanently and            provably deleted from user systems once allowed use periods have expired. (We note             that permanent deletion is nearly impossible, unless the data is only stored in encrypted              form and all that must be thoroughly deleted is the decryption key to the data).    ● World citizenship is a responsibility. NSDS should become an integral part of the             United Nations Statistics Division, participating as do the National Statistics Offices of            other United Nations member states.  5. How can federal agencies protect individual and organizational privacy when using data for              evidence building?  Protection of privacy is exactly protection of private data. That protection is never as easy as we                 think. In particular, data privacy protection is  ● End to end. ​Data should always and only be stored and operated on via cryptographic               primitives that are proven secure and widely adopted by the cryptography and security             community.   ● More than end to end. ​In the case of evidence building via statistical analysis, data               should be appropriately obfuscated via differential privacy technology in order to avoid            pitfalls of traditional de-anonymization that allow for record reconstructions from          statistical outputs.  ● Technically explainable. ​Federal agencies should employ metrics that quantify and          explain the privacy loss incurred by any (and especially multiple) queries made to data              sources they provide. These metrics should be consulted prior to results of queries being              released. Such metrics can be for example computed via techniques such as            quantitative information flow analysis conducted ​at runtime and before results are           released or decrypted.  ● Composable. ​When analysis over data is composed of successive operations, those           composite operations should be provably secure. Note that compositional security does           not necessarily follow from the security of individually secure operations.  ● Proven and standardized. ​Federal agencies should standardize and continuously         update a set of secure computation protocols that are proven suitably secure for use in               inter-agency secure data sharing. This set should only include techniques that have            cryptographically proven security. Implementations of such protocols should be formally          verified equivalent to the abstract specifications of those protocols.   ● Transparent. ​Protocols used by federal agencies for securing privacy should be           consistently released to the public in open source form so that their security can be               continuously vetted by watchdog organizations.  ● Up to date. ​Agencies should together keep a list of protocols that are discovered to be                insecure due to known vulnerabilities. This list should be openly shared, and should be              consulted by agencies as they make decisions on securing data.  6. If created, how should a data service be structured to best facilitate (1) research and                development of secure data access and confidentiality technologies and methods, (2) and            agency adoption of those technologies and techniques?  Technology is the easy part of a secure data service. Looking to the future, educating the public,                 listening and responding, and facilitating are the harder parts. Correctly structuring a secure             data service to meet these needs is paramount. The NSDS needs to    ● Look to the future. ​NSDS should include a specific subsidiary that sponsors and directs              research in 1) improving performance of security measures, because today many           relevant measures are very slow; 2) improving usability, because cryptographic          techniques are hard to use and require substantial but rare skills to use correctly; and 3)                extending secure data sharing techniques to apply to additional domains. This           sponsorship might be patterned after the Broad Area Announcements used to sponsor            research today in several Government research agencies.  ● Educate Congress and the public. ​NSDS should include an education subsidiary to            elevate the public's understanding of how NSDS techniques protect personal privacy.           This subsidiary should also advocate at US universities for the creation of specific             research initiatives aimed to research and solve fundamental theoretical challenges          needed for the future of assuring data privacy.  ● Listen and respond. ​NSDS should include an Office of the Ombudsman to listen             actively to concerns of US citizens about privacy involving data catalogued by NSDS.             This office should address those concerns either by 1) changing NSDS policy; 2)             requiring the research subsidiary to create new programs to address the concern; or 3)              requiring the education subsidiary to improve educational resources to resolve concerns           due to misunderstandings.  ● Enable and uplift. ​NSDS should include an Application Services team that builds and             deploys ​de novo application solutions for federal agencies who wish to use secure data              sharing approaches, but do not have the expertise or resources to implement such             solutions.  ● Grow and offer value. ​NSDS should include (as described above) a comprehensive            Data Catalog service, with a group of ​librarians who actively seek out new data sets to                add to that catalog, and work with providers of that data so that it meets the standards                 for inclusion in the catalog.  ● Measure and relentlessly improve. ​NSDS should include a technical advisory board           tasked with identifying appropriate quantitative metrics for privacy and utility, and tasked            with technical review and evaluation of proposed research projects and their outcomes            from the research subsidiary.
