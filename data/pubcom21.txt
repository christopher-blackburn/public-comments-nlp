What are examples of high-impact data use for evidence-based policy making that successfully effected change, reduced costs, or improved the welfare of citizens?  3. Which frameworks, policies, practices, or methods show promise in overcoming challenges experienced by governments in their evidence building?  5. How can federal agencies protect individual and organizational privacy when using data for evidence building?  8. What are the most pressing data needs of state and local decision makers and how would making data accessible from federal agencies help meet those needs? To share data, what guarantees do data owners (or data controllers) need regarding privacy, data stewardship, and retention?   In brief, we believe federal agencies must prioritize the collection of civil rights data because accurate and robust data are necessary to understand barriers to social and economic opportunity, ensure equal treatment under the law, and monitor the progress of government programs meant to close opportunity gaps as opposed to further entrench them.2    1 Request for Comments for the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building, 85 FR 81179 (December 15, 2020) https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/15/2020-27489/request-for-comments-for-the-advisory-committee-on-data-for-evidence-building.  2 Misinformation Nation: The Threat to America’s Federal Data and Civil Rights, The Leadership Conference Education Fund (December 2017) http://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/policy/Data-Policy-Brief.pdf       February 9, 2021 Page 2 of 5   In 2019, our sister organization, The Leadership Conference Education Fund, published a paper underscoring the importance of federal data collection and offering principles that will ensure the continued availability and value of federal data for civil rights policy and enforcement purposes:3   1. Prioritize public input for civil rights data.  Federal statistical agencies exist for the purpose of providing objective, accurate information that is relevant for policy and public use by a wide range of stakeholders.4 As both end-users of federal government data and, often, as representatives of vulnerable communities, civil rights organizations and leaders offer a perspective on the value and importance of specific data collections that federal agencies themselves do not always have. That perspective is lost when federal agencies or the White House make decisions about data collections without seeking the perspective of external advocates, as was the case with the Office of Management and Budget’s cancellation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s equal pay data collection. Federal agencies should consistently provide notice and an opportunity for public comment by all affected stakeholders when any change in a current data collection would affect civil rights policy or enforcement.  2. Maintain public accessibility of civil rights data.  The public not only pays for federal data collection, processing, and analysis through tax dollars, but also is the source for a significant portion of federal data through its role as respondents, directly or indirectly.5 Federal statistical agencies, therefore, should recognize the public’s “ownership” of data products and should scrupulously uphold their public availability. The previous administration took unprecedented steps to remove federal data from the public domain, as with the drastic reduction in data tables in the 2017 Crime in the United States report. Civil rights-related data and other information that could help policymakers, advocates, and litigators address the distinct needs of vulnerable populations should always be made publicly available, subject only to constraints necessary to protect confidentiality or personal privacy.  3. Collect data that enhances the visibility of all communities.  Inclusion in federal data collection programs is a critical way to ensure the visibility of and attention to diverse marginalized communities. Whether the disaggregation of data about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, cross-tabulation that describes the experiences of African American women, or data about recent immigrants in the labor force, information about all people is critical to ensuring that communities are seen, and their needs are addressed. LGBTQ individuals and families face heightened levels of poverty, economic vulnerability, and discrimination across all areas of civic life (including in employment, housing, education, and health care), with accompanying difficulty accessing federal   3 Misinformation Nation II: A Deeper Dive into Threats to Federal Civil Rights Data Collection, The Leadership Conference Education Fund (March 2019) http://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/reports/Misinformation-Nation-2.pdf.  4 National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency 41 (6th ed. 2017). 5 Id.

Withholding data from legislators, policy- makers, and advocates denied them the tools they need to comprehensively assess LGBTQ-related policies, estimate the impact of those policies, and advocate for the fair treatment of LGBTQ people.7 An attack on data about one community undermines our understanding of all communities.  4. Adopt the principles from the Civil Rights, Privacy, and Technology Table.  Technological progress should promote equity and justice as it enhances safety, economic opportunity, and convenience for everyone. But far too often, people subject to historical and ongoing discrimination — including Black, Indigenous, and all communities of color; religious and ethnic minorities; people living on low-income; the LGBTQ community; people with disabilities; people who have been incarcerated; women; and others — face disproportionate surveillance and bear the brunt of harms amplified by new technologies. There is an urgent need for new legal protections to ensure that technology is designed and used in ways that respect civil rights, preserve privacy, ensure transparency, and hold both nation-states and companies accountable for harm. In 2020, The Leadership Conference, joined by 24 groups, updated the Civil Rights Principles for the Era of Big Data8 and proposed a set of civil rights protections, including:   • Ending High-Tech Profiling § Surveillance technologies are empowering governments and companies to collect and  analyze vast amounts of information about people. Too often, these tools are deployed without proper safeguards, or are themselves biased. In some cases, surveillance technologies should simply never be deployed. In other cases, clear limitations and robust auditing mechanisms are needed to ensure that these tools are used in a responsible and equitable way. The law should hold both the government and private actors accountable for abuses.  • Ensuring Justice in Automated Decisions § Statistical technologies, including machine learning, are informing important decisions in  areas such as employment, health, education, lending, housing, immigration, and the criminal legal system. Decision-making technologies too often replicate and amplify patterns of discrimination in society. These tools must be judged not only by their design but also, even primarily, by their impacts – especially on communities that have been historically marginalized. Transparency and oversight are imperative to ensuring that these systems promote just and equitable outcomes, and in many cases the best outcome is to not use automated tools in high-stakes decisions at all.   6 E.g., M.V.

February 9, 2021 Page 4 of 5   • Preserving Constitutional Principles § Enforcement of constitutional principles such as equal protection and due process must  keep pace with government use of technology. Search warrant requirements and other limitations on surveillance and policing are critical to protecting fundamental civil rights and civil liberties, especially for communities who have been historically marginalized and subject to disproportionate government surveillance. Moreover, governments should not compel companies to build technologies that undermine basic rights, including freedom of expression, privacy, and freedom of association.  • Ensuring that Technology Serves People Historically Subject to Discrimination § Technology should not merely avoid harm, but actively make people’s lives better.  Governments, companies, and individuals who design and deploy technology should strive to mitigate societal inequities. This includes improving access to the internet and addressing biases in data and decision-making. Technologies should be deployed in close consultation with the most affected communities, especially those who have historically suffered the harms of discrimination.  • Defining Responsible Use of Personal Information and Enhancing Individual Rights § Corporations have pervasive access to people's personal data, which can lead to  discriminatory, predatory, and unsafe practices. Personal data collected by companies also often end up in the hands of the government, either through the direct sale of personal data or through data-driven systems purpose-built for the government. Clear baseline protections for data collection, including both primary and secondary uses of data, should be enacted to help prevent these harms.  • Making Systems Transparent and Accountable § Governments and corporations must provide people with clear, concise, and easily  accessible information on what data they collect and how it is used. This information can help equip advocates and individuals with the information to ensure that technologies are used in equitable and just ways. Any technology that has a consequential impact on people’s lives should be deployed with a comprehensive, accessible, and fair appeals process with robust mechanisms for enforcement, and governments and corporations must be accountable for any misuse of technology or data. When careful examination reveals that a new, invasive technology poses threats to civil rights and civil liberties, such technology should not be used under any circumstance.9   5. Appoint nonpartisan professionals to leadership positions.  Finally, the previous administration’s staffing approaches for key leadership positions at the Bureau of Justice Statistics and elsewhere demonstrated disregard for the longstanding norm that federal statistical agencies should be led by qualified, nonpartisan professionals with relevant subject-matter expertise and management experience. Even worse than lacking relevant qualifications, the previous administration’s appointees appeared in some cases to be hostile to the imperative that federal data allow for the ongoing implementation and monitoring of civil rights laws and policies. Statistical agencies that collect data for   9 Civil Rights, Privacy, and Technology Table, Principles (2020) https://www.civilrightstable.org/principles/.        February 9, 2021 Page 5 of 5   civil rights purposes should be insulated from partisan efforts to divert or curtail their agendas, and the norm of nonpartisan, professional, and experienced leadership should be restored.  Civil and human rights advocates have long supported the federal government’s collection and analysis of data in a way that enhances the enforcement of civil rights laws and facilitates a better understanding of barriers to opportunity for diverse communities throughout the country. Rigorous collection of reliable and meaningful data for civil rights purposes must therefore remain a core activity of federal agencies.  Thank you for embarking on this important process. We are ready to work with you to ensure that the voices of the civil and human rights community are heard in this important, ongoing national conversation.
