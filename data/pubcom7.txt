 Forum Looking Backward but MovingForward: Honoring the Sacredand Asserting the Sovereignin Indigenous Evaluation Waapalaneexkweew (Nicole R. Bowman-Farrell,Mohican/Lunaape) 1,2 Abstract Culturally responsive evaluation and culturally responsive Indigenous evaluation (CRIE) within thebroader field of evaluation are not often included in Western literature nor are they known or usedby the majority of mainstream evaluators. In order to address this literature and practice gap, thisarticle offers an overview and a broader origin story of CRIE prior to colonial or European contact inthe United States and gives an overview of the historical, theoretical, and practical foundations forconducting CRIE in a contemporary evaluation context. Examples of evidence-based models, the-ories, and resources are provided to connect CRIE to Western evaluation designs and provideconcrete strategies for the field of evaluation going forward. The article concludes with systemic andpolicy evaluation considerations as agencies from federal (i.e., United States), tribal, and internationalgovernments and partners from private or nonprofit sectors collaborate to carry out Indigenousevaluations in the future. Collectively this multijurisdictional, culturally responsive, and community-centered CRIE approach gives evaluators a new way to move forward.

Rather, Americanracism is created and recreated in the present. Several identifiable social entities, mechan- isms, processes, and structures currently generate racist beliefs and behaviors. � Supposition #3: Evaluation plays an important role in these processes. Evaluation is not acause of the racism but for racist processes to have their effects, the evaluation function must be distorted, co-opted, or corrupted. Given my education and experience as an evaluator, and my own Indigenous cultural identity (Mohican and Lunaape-Munsee) located within North America, these suppositions resonate deeply. In this article, I seek to help my fellow evaluators recognize the extent and nature of the racism (Supposition #1) that affects Indigenous people in North America. I examine both its historic roots and the ways in which this racism is created and recreated in the present (Supposition #2), particularly in terms of Tribal nation exclusion by governance and sovereignty subject matter experts in the literature (Schoenfeld & Jordan, 2017). This basic understanding of historical and contemporary context vis-à- vis Indigenous populations and Tribal Nations is an essential grounding for any evaluators’ knowl- edge, competencies, and skills when conducting evaluations with Indigenous participants. This article also seeks to outline methods for recognizing and combatting the ways in which the evaluation function is distorted, co-opted, and corrupted (Supposition #3) in the Indigenous context when non-Tribal or unexpected evaluators lead and conduct evaluations with Tribal Nations and participants. I hope to contribute toward building both cultural competencies and scientific skills of my evaluation colleagues. Given the increasing awareness that scholars in our field exhibit toward social justice as it pertains to evaluation, we need to critically examine whether intended responsive and Western evaluations actually practice what we now preach. As evaluators, we must discern our level of accountability for distorting, co-opting, corrupting, or racially biasing the evaluation process in Indigenous contexts. If we do not have awareness, education, or understanding of this history, then we cannot function at our highest level as technically competent and culturally responsive evaluators—and we may even be causing harm, as House asserts in his 2015 keynote. To address this content gap and perpetuation of harm due to lack of cultural and technical knowledge and skills, this article shares Indigenous contributions and culturally responsive strategies that evaluators can bring to their future work with Indigenous populations. The discussion primarily focuses on the context of Indigenous peoples in the current United States of America, but models and resources from other Indigenous contexts are also shared with an explicit focus on Indigenous evaluation (IE) program or project evaluation strategies. I use the term Indigenous to describe myself and other members of communities of the Original Inhabitants of the land, in this instance, Takwáx Mūnáhan (Turtle Island, aka North America). As Smith (2012) notes, the term Indigenous has historic resonance as “‘Indigenous peoples’ is a 1970s term from the American Indian Movement to internationalize experiences of Indigenous peoples around Mother Earth. It represents our collective voices to finish the unfinished business of decolonization” (p. 7). Where I am able and as appropriate, I use my Lunaape (Delaware) or Moh-he-con-nuk (Mohican) language, traditional knowledge, and terms within this article. This conscious act of literary decolonization honors my Lunaape, Mohican, and Indigenous ancestors and relatives who are voiceless and/or who can only be with me in spirit, fulfilling the responsibility I have been given as Waapalaneexkweew (Flying Eagle Woman, accompanied by the Four Eagles) to 2 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   promote the teachings that accompany my Indigenous spirit name. My academic and professional work is grounded in community, language, and culture because it respects the past, acknowledges the present, and affirms my commitment to the future seven generations.1 Using the traditional “four doors” from the Lunaape/Mohican seven directions cultural teachings (used during Indigenous longhouse teachings, in sweat lodges, or other ceremonies), I have orga- nized this article’s content around four themes or doors to demonstrate the use of traditional knowledge and its application to contemporary practice: 1. Ktanaxkihlaak (Kah-taw-nah-x-kee-lock)—Eastern Door: Origin Story—Situating Evalua- tion Within a Broader Historical Context. This section situates IE within a broader historical context and offers an Indigenous perspective to the historic narrative that is often missing in our academic literature or professional development and higher education curricula. 2. Shaawaneewang (Shaw-one-neh-wung)—Southern Door: Political, Legal, and Institutiona- lized Postcolonial Impacts. This section explains postcolonial contact impacts, showing how interactions from early treaties to contemporary policy shaped colonial/United States and Tribal Nation government relations and how these political/legal components are often ignored but case-law findings/judgments are shaping policies and therefore should be con- sidered in evaluation profession and practice. 3. Wsihkaang (wh-see-kong)—Western Door: Perseverance and Unknown Potentiality. This section shares the untapped potential available to persevere and rebuild colonial and tribal relations. Examples of Indigenous theories, methods, and evidence-based models demon- strate how evaluation practice can change and how IE is connected to or can modify many of the Western models and strategies that evaluators use. 4. Loowaneewang (Low-one-neh-wung)—Northern Door: Elder Wisdom to Guide New Begin- nings. This section brings us full circle, offering guidance for our professional evaluation practice and broadly to the field of evaluation. This article offers a broad framing of evaluation theories, methods, and frameworks that are culturally responsive and have worked well within Indigenous contexts. This broad framing, with examples, is situated within an historical context so readers understand how culturally responsive Indigenous evalua- tion (CRIE) was influenced and is a needed response to other activities, methods, theories, and lived experiences that have not worked well for Indigenous communities and Tribal Nations. So, the article should be considered a resource for understanding evaluation that has been used within Indigenous contexts (primarily within the Indigenous north of the United States of America) that have helped, caused harm, or leaves gaps still that the field of evaluation can consider. A deeper dive into an emerging evidence-based and applied culturally responsive evaluation (CRE) model can be further understood via Bowman (2016, 2017); Bowman, Dodge-Francis, and Tyndall (2015); and Waapalaneexkweew (Nicole Bowman, Mohican/Lunaape) and Dodge-Francis (2018). The article concludes with an overview of methods, theories, frameworks, and tools that can be used for CRIE when working with Indigenous populations and Tribal Nations. See also Appendix C of this article for additional Tribal and Indigenous Institutional Review Board (IRB) and journal articles and resources. Ktanaxkihlaak (Kah-taw-nah-x-kee-lock)—Eastern Door: OriginStory—Situating Evaluation Within a Broader Historical Context Lunaape Eastern Door teachings (the Original “red” people indigenous to this land are awake with the rising of the sun and are born new like in springtime in this Eastern direction). This section presents an Indigenous version of the origin story of “democracy” in the United States, helping us recognize the Waapalaneexkweew 3   extent and nature of the racism underpinning interactions between Indigenous peoples and their colo- nizers that continues to this day, and how that shared history shapes contemporary evaluation. The history of Indigenous populations is rarely taught in classrooms, universities, or professional evalua- tion curricula. Newcomb (2008), writing from an Indigenous perspective, characterizes the standard, Western historical narrative as the conqueror model (p. 23–36), a narrative framework of conquest, ownership, and discovery based in a Western, Christian story that justifies domination of Indigenous people who are viewed as less than human. Under this narrative, historical texts are premised on the idea that colonials and Christians from Europe “discovered” a “new world,” a world they viewed as unin- habited by humans. Indigenous people were seen as savages rather than human because they were pagan rather than Christian, per the Doctrine of Discovery (Alexander VI, 1493). This Western narrative continues to marginalize and distort the experiences of Indigenous people to this day. Examples include contemporary, romanticized stories of the first Thanksgiving where everyone got along, and the mistaken notion that Indigenous people should somehow “get over” the harm caused by colonization given the so- called benefits to society provided by the industrialization of the United States via Manifest Destiny. The historic narrative is different when viewed through an Indigenous perspective. The pre- and post-contact map below clearly illustrates one aspect of the impact of colonial contact and the theft of economic, political, and natural resources accomplished through forced removal, assimilation, termination, and allotment policies created and enforced by the U.S. government. Additionally, these policies of assimilation and forced removal resulted in death, loss of culture and language, and undermined the political, economic, and social power that Tribes had under Treaty Law (early contact) and constitutional law (contemporary times; Figure 1; see also Appendix A). These pre- and post-colonial contact maps teach us about the impacts of colonialism upon Indigenous people and their relationship to the land and land ownership. It is difficult, but important, to acknowledge the cruelty and brutality with which this land grab was enacted: scalping, raping, torturing, hanging, poisoning, freezing, and killing Indigenous people were preliminary methods (Brown, 1970; Deloria, 1985; Ehle, 1988; Furse & Miller, 2008; Lyons, Mohawk, Inouye, & Mathhiessen, 1998; Stannard, 1992; Wilson, 1998), while the destruction of culture, language, and family and tribal structures through forced assimilation and boarding schools were more “civilized” tactics used to “kill the Indian and save the man” (“Capt. Richard H. Pratt on the Education of Native Americans,” n.d.) while taking his land. Destruction of ceremonies and significance of the place of origin by forced removal not only “kills the Indian” but also imperils the men, women, and children of current or future generations because the culture, language, and traditional knowledge needed for healthy survival have been decimated. Indigenous intergenerational trauma is a response to the past and present unacknowledged and unaddressed effects of colonial and contemporary contact with non-Indigenous people, organiza- tions, and systems. A large body of research supports this assertion; postcolonial trauma may be the foundational reason for disproportionately high levels of suicide, lateral or other violence, substance abuse, and incarceration rates for Indigenous populations (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Brown- Rice, 2013; Chandler, Lalonde, Sokol, & Hallett, 2003; d’Errico, 2016; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Myhra, 2011). Understanding historical, cultural, and community content can help evaluators to design appropriate and responsive evaluation studies. Thus, evaluators who approach an Indigenous community should not expect to impose a model, evaluation design, instruments, or tools upon the members of that community. Vast differences between Western and Indigenous cultures are highlighted in the context of evaluation. For example, evaluations have privileged written and published evidence over oral history and traditional knowl- edge passed down through language, ceremonies, and songs. As well, evaluations have prioritized Western concepts of ownership such as data, knowledge, and intellectual property of individuals over acting as caretakers of knowledge, community, or family over individualism, and relational interactions and responsibilities to all things in nature, the spirit world, and each other. Similarly, 4 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   assuming that outside evaluators are the only “subject matter experts” (SMEs); reporting findings only in formats and venues that are accessible to evaluators, academics, or study funders; and having Western notions of extracting and “owning” the data are all examples of how colonialist practices are replicated in the present-day evaluation. Without Indigenous voices in the academic discourse, the field of evaluation either replicates incorrect assumptions about Indigenous communities or operates ineffectively without the proper skills, content knowledge, or a contextualized understanding learned through experience. Listening to these voices and working to understand the history and effects of colonialism on Indigenous populations from the past can serve to ensure that evaluation practice does not replicate these destructive historic patterns and practices in the present. Traditional cultural practices and knowl- edge persist to this day in different forms, held by elders, traditional community teachers, and those Figure 1. Indian Land Cessions.

These traditions, where appropriate and available for public sharing, should be incorporated into our evaluation knowledge, competencies, and skills as technical and culturally responsive evaluators. Inclusion of Indigenous traditions is a start, but I believe our profession is called to be proactive—to change mind-sets, behaviors, and resources to reach a critical mass for addressing institutionalized and systemic change. As a profession, we need to critically question the structures and systems that perpe- tuate or legitimize implicit or explicit racism. Using a strengths-based approach, the evaluation field can start by including Indigenous SMEs on key initiatives and make access and resources more avail- able, so that truly collaborative studies with Indigenous scholars can contribute to the “evidence- based” policies, programming, committees, and practice. Together, we can be more purposeful, active, and accountable with these inputs, so that the outputs, outcomes, and studies produce new knowledge from which Indigenous communities, our profession, and academia can all benefit. Shaawaneewang (Shaw-one-neh-wung)—Southern Door: Political,Legal, and Institutionalized Postcolonial Impacts Lunaape Southern Door teachings (the people are growing stronger and continue learning under the yellow splendor of the sun). The Lunaape prophesized the coming of the shëwanàkw (people from the salty water, long knife, Colonists). Lunaape and Mohican creation stories explained that some Indigen- ous people would stay and fight while others would move or be removed to other places on Turtle Island. After learning, struggling, and growing, the people would then come back together to learn from one another and traditional teachings to survive in a contemporary world. The Southern door explains why postcolonial contact political and legal interactions must be considered when designing evaluations with Indigenous communities. House and Howe (2000) stress the importance of understanding context when conducting delib- erative democratic evaluations, “Evaluation always exists within some authority structure, some particular social system. It is not simply a logic or a methodology free of time and space, and it is certainly not free of values or interests. Rather evaluation practices are firmly embedded in and inextricably tied to particular social and institutional structures and practices” (p. 3). It is critical for professional evaluators to understand the origins of the “authority structure” in which we practice evaluation with Indigenous people. The philosophies justifying the means by which resources, political power, and governance were taken from Indigenous people from the early 1400s to the present have shaped our evaluation practice today. The legal and political components unique to sovereign tribal governments, which also extend to Indigenous programs and community members, are little known and rarely considered when conducing evaluation with Indigenous populations. From the past to the present, Indigenous people and sovereign tribal governments have been marginalized and excluded at best. What are the roots of this historic and continuing marginaliza- tion? The earliest “relationship” between Indigenous people and communities was enshrined in Christian and European policies related to the Catholic Church’s Doctrine of Discovery (Alexander VI, 1493; Newcomb, 1992). This religious and political doctrine supported Spain’s right to lands that Columbus discovered in 1492, stating “that any land not inhabited by Christians was available to be ‘discovered,’ claimed, and exploited by Christian rulers” (Newcomb, 1992) and declared that “the Catholic faith and the Christian religion be exalted and be everywhere increased and spread, that the health of souls be cared for and that barbarous nations [Indigenous people] be overthrown and brought to the faith itself” (Alexander VI, 1493, para. 1). This doctrine was the justification for Europe’s conquest of Turtle Island (North America) and was the legal foundation used for the United States’ philosophy of westward expansion. It also underpins contemporary rationales for legal and political relationships with Tribes through treaties and the U.S. Constitution. 6 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   When agreements are created under the assumptions of this doctrine, that is, that one partner to the agreement is intrinsically less worthy, they are essentially made to be broken. During the Treaty era, tribes and the colonial government entered into 384 treaties (Kappler, 1904). The Oklahoma State University Library’s searchable database (Oklahoma State University Library, n.d.) identifies 146 education-related treaties; 17 of these are related to my tribal affiliations under various names: Lunaape, Delaware, New York Indians, and Stockbridge-Munsee. To date, none of the treaties have been honored or upheld by the U.S. government. Why is treaty law important? Because treaties are the “supreme law of the land” and form the basis for contemporary U.S./tribal government relationships on a legal, policy, and governance level. Treaty law serves as the foundation to contemporary constitutional law between Tribal Nations and the United States. Wilkinson and Miklas (1988) summarize three principles regarding the legal relationship between the colonial U.S. government and Tribal Nations, found in provisions of the U.S. Constitution and upheld within Supreme Court rulings: � Territorial sovereignty. Tribal authority on Indian land is organic and is not granted by thestates in which Indian lands are located. � Plenary power doctrine. Congress has ultimate authority regarding matters affecting theIndian Tribes. Federal courts give greater deference to Congress on Indian matters than on other subjects. � Trust relationship. The federal government has a “duty to protect” the tribes, implying thenecessary legislative and executive authority to fulfill that duty. Unfortunately, despite these foundational understandings concerning tribal sovereignty, three legal precedents referred to as the Marshal Trilogy (Johnson v. McIntosh, 1823; Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 1831; and Worchester v. Georgia, 1832) continue to be used to support Supreme Court decisions (Newcomb, 1992) regarding Tribal Nations. These legal foundations and standards used against Tribal Nations continue to give the U.S. government (i.e., the colonists) absolute rights, rendering Indigenous human rights nonexistent, leaving Indigenous communities unacknowledged and with little to no legal recourse.2 Ultimately, however, unlike any other group in the United States, only Indigenous people and tribal governments have the legal and political distinction of sovereignty under the U.S. Constitu- tion. Tribes have the inherent authority to govern themselves. Through treaties and the constitution, the federal government defines Tribal Nations as “domestic dependent nations” and has established laws attempting to clarify the relationship between the federal, state, and tribal governments. Although the legal foundations of the sovereign status of Indigenous people in the United States are clear, Western perceptions and institutional acceptance of Indigenous legal rights have varied widely over time. Generally, from the inception of the United States until 1871, tribes were recog- nized as sovereign entities with whom treaties should be negotiated (even if those treaties were regularly broken). However, from 1887 through 1968, the main thrust of the government’s political and legal interaction with Tribes was to disregard their sovereign status, allot land on an individual basis, and assimilate Indigenous people into White political, social, cultural, and economic systems as much as possible. Since 1968, in conjunction with the civil rights movement, tribal governments and Indigenous people have worked hard to restore their nationhood, their communities, their families, and their lives. The importance of Indigenous sovereignty in the United States is further reinforced by the United Nations (UN) Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2008), which was finally signed by the United States in 2016, and the newly created American Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People (Organization of American States, 2016). Understanding and incorporating both the legal and political aspects of sovereign Tribal Nations along with culture, Waapalaneexkweew 7   language, and community context are all integral to designing and carrying out rigorous and responsive evaluation studies. Sadly, political manifestations of the conqueror model (Newcomb, 2008, pp. 23–36) are alive and well. Left unchallenged, the conqueror model supports “a state of domination which correlates with the original founding of the USA as the American empire” (Newcomb, 2008, p. 23). For example, despite their sovereign status under treaties with the United States, the Standing Rock people and tribal government have been unable to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on sovereign tribal lands, which are also environmentally sensitive sacred burial and cultural grounds for the Sioux Nation. Since the DAPL protest (NoDAPL) began in January 2016 (National Public Radio, 2017), multiple federal court cases have ruled against the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Indigenous people, allowing incarceration of and harm to them and their non-Indigenous supporters (National Public Radio, 2017) to continue. At the hands of the state and federal government, many people were physically and psychologically harmed, tribal cultural artifacts were destroyed, and sacred sites were burned. Even when conquered and forcibly removed to reservation lands, sover- eign Indigenous governments are denied sovereignty when it conflicts with what colonists and modern-day corporate or nontribal government partners want. The field of evaluation is not exempt from these political manifestations of colonial might against tribal sovereignty. Colonialism continues in terms of appropriation of Indigenous intellectual prop- erty as well. A new U.S. federal rule (Federal policy for the protection of human subjects, 82 FR 7261, 2017) exempts oral history from IRB review (Flaherty, 2017) and has dire implications for Indigenous populations and tribal governments. The final document defines research as, “A sys- tematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities that meet this federal definition constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program that is considered research for other purposes” (Federal policy for the protection of human subjects, 82 FR 7261, 2017). This decision was reached without any legal or formal consultation with tribal governments; the representation of Indigenous populations regarding this decision was low or nonexistent, as with most the scientific activities of the federal government. Other provisions of the FR that further erode the value of Indigenous voices state that the following activities are not “deemed to be research”: “(1) scholarly and journalistic activities (e.g., oral history, journalism, biography, literary criticism, legal research, and historical scholarship) including the collection and use of information, that focus directly on the specific individuals about whom the information is collected” (Federal policy for the protection of human subjects, 82 FR 7261, 2017, p. 7261; empha- sis added). Indigenous people were not “seen” or considered human under the Doctrine of Discovery and Christianity in the 1400s; this lack of “seeing” is exactly what continues to happen over five centuries later. Recognition of the legal implications of Indigenous sovereignty must inform our work with Indigenous communities. It is not simply culturally responsive, it is a legal and moral imperative that we move beyond the “beads and feathers” linguistic and cultural aspects of evaluation to work with tribal governments and communities as sovereign partners. For example, when tribal and nontribal partners work together, they should, whenever possible, obtain permission from a tribal IRB (Bowman & Dodge-Francis 2018; Bowman, Dodge-Francis, & Tyndall, 2015; Harding et al., 2012; National Congress of American Indians, 2017). The tribal IRB may be administered by the formal tribal government, approved through a traditional governance model of elders and chiefs, situated at a tribal college/university or tribal clinic, or a combination of these. Fulfilling the technical and scientific requirements for human subjects’ protection thus takes on unique meaning, beyond culture, indicating respect for and recognition of the distinct legal/political sovereign status of tribal governments when creating and conducting evaluations. Instances where Tribes asserted their sovereignty in partnership with others have resulted in many positive policy and program 8 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   changes in education, economic development, health, justice, and human services (Bowman, 2015; Champagne, 1997; Cornell & Kalt, 2010; National Congress of American Indians, n.d.; see Appen- dix C for additional information on tribal IRBs). In the preface to his reissued master work Custer Died for Your Sins, Deloria (1988) lamented that in the two decades since the book’s original publication in the 1960s, despite all best efforts, Indigenous people in the United States still did not have a “clear and workable definition of how the Indians and the Federal government should deal with each other” (p. viii). This holds true today, nearly 30 years later. Without a collective effort, Indigenous people will continue to remain invi- sible, excluded, and suffer continued trauma and impacts based on the history. Contemporary policy and practice by the academic and evaluation community has an opportunity to further increase the ways we can work with (not on) Indigenous people and tribal governments. The following section shares ways in which the evaluation community can contribute to the systemic and sustainable change needed to shift this inequitable balance of political power. Wsihkaang (wh-see-kong)—Western Door: Perseverance andUnknown Potentiality Lunaape Western Door teachings (where the sun sets as adults, the people are in the autumn season of their lives). The Western door shares the potential to persevere and establish new and better colonial and Tribal relations. This section presents Indigenous theories, methods, and frameworks that can inform evaluators’ practice. The Western door teaches evaluators that if we go in a good way, purposefully into the unknown direction of the West, and are of good mind, heart, and spirit, the potential for new learning and innovative ways of doing our work is limitless. In this section, I offer Indigenous perspectives, theories, and methods—tools that enable evalua- tors to do work differently as collaborators with tribal populations and sovereign tribal governments. The Indigenous framing of evaluation recognizes the evaluation literature and is related to some of the more recent Western and culturally responsive evaluation (CRE) frameworks published, espe- cially within the last decade. This section is not intended as an exhaustive explanation of any one IE model but rather aims to provide background and an overview of Indigenous theories, methods, and models available that align well with some Western models for culturally responsive and IE. IE was virtually absent in the early broader evaluation literature or “creation narrative” until the champions of transformative, social justice, and CRE arrived and first published during the civil rights era (Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment [CREA], 2016). Social justice movements and culturally responsive and IE have strong foundations (Bowman et al., 2015; Cram, 2015, 2016; Cram & Mertens, 2015, 2016; Hood, 2001; Hood & Hopson, 2008; Hood, Hopson & Frierson, 2005, 2015; Hopson, Kirkhart, & Bledsoe, 2012; Kirkhart, 2005, 2010; LaFrance & Nichols, 2010; Mertens, Cram, & Chilisa, 2013; Smith, 2012). In the 1970s, the culturally responsive approach influenced evaluation (Stake, 1972). Culturally responsive pedagogy and curriculum efforts prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s (CREA, 2016) helped to decentralize evaluation. The community context and cultural values, practices, and experiences of participants became the drive of the evaluation. Instead of the funding agency being the only or primary driver to evaluation, CRE allowed a more responsive evaluation model where social justice and evaluation meet for getting closer to understanding and transforming the root causes of community issues, gaps, and long-standing problems of health, social, educational, or economic factors participants of programming faced. Building off of the responsive evaluation design (Stake, 1972), CRE deepened evaluation to locally situate and study issues of importance to community members and stakeholders who are most impacted by the or those who have the most at stake in the Waapalaneexkweew 9   evaluation results, including underrepresented and vulnerable populations (Hood, 1999, 2001; Hood, Hopson, & Frierson, 2005, 2015). CRE continues to transform the contemporary evaluation field and profession by contributing to and diversifying the mostly monolithic literature; challenging privilege to expand cultural and technical scientific competencies, capacities, and skills that the evaluation profession desperately needs; and creating innovative, empowered, and self-governing spaces where culture, context, and community weave together to ground evaluation profession and practice. CRE should not be nar- rowly defined as a response to the cultural, theoretical, philosophical, methodological, professional, and organizational incongruence that underserved and underrepresented evaluators and commu- nities continually experience within colonialized and privileged contexts and paradigms. More purposeful and empowering, CRE is a welcoming space where evaluators and evaluations honor the strengths, respect the diversity, and authentically include, engage, and empower evaluators and the communities they are working with (not “on”) in the evaluative process, so they can be their own social justice and transformative leaders for creating and sustaining local change. IE is related to and a partner of CRE; one difference is that Tribal Nations and American Indian populations (in the United States and other places around the world) are the only racial/ethnic group with dual citizenship and government sovereignty that is equal to the United States or other inter- national governments from a political and legal standpoint. That will be discussed later in this article. Origins of IE are found in contemporary evaluation publications as early as the 1960s, with roots in public health and public policy administration (Hutchinson, 1960; McQueen, Lewis, & Schneider, 1960). IE has grown through the decades, especially in countries outside of the United States (Bowman, 2006, 2017; Chouinard & Cousins, 2007; Denzin, Lincoln, & Smith, 2012; Kawa- kami, Aton, Cram, Lai, & Porima, 2007; LaFrance & Nichols, 2010; Mertens et al., 2013; Smith, 2006, 2012; Wehipeihana, Bailey, Davidson, & McKegg, 2014). Within the United States, Indigen- ous evaluators were less prominent, but their influence has been felt and is growing over time (American Indian Higher Education Consortium, 2012; Bowman et al., 2015; Kawakami et al., 2007; LaFrance & Nichols, 2010; Robertson, Jorgensen, & Garrow, 2004; Yellow Bird, Bowman, Steichen, & Brandon, 2007). In their foundational study, LaFrance and Nichols (2010) state that Indigenous knowledge cre- ation is critical to IE and identify four core tenets of IE: (1) being people of a place, (2) recognizing our gifts, (3) honoring family and community, and (4) respecting sovereignty. These core tenets honor and align with the key issues and concerns identified as critical, historic problems for Indi- genous people in the Eastern and Southern door sections of this article. Building upon the foundation of CRE and the original IE definition, I further proposed a working definition of a CRIE model:3 An Indigenous Self-Determination Evaluation Model respects, recognizes, and values the inherent worth of Indian culture; is responsive to the communities’ needs as voiced by all members of the tribal community; builds evaluation designs and processes around Indian assets and resources; and literally and figuratively employs Indians in every part of the process (program, policy, implementation, evaluation) to heal, strengthen, and preserve Indigenous societies for the next 7 generations. (Bowman, 2005, p. 8) CRIE is about working “with” the community and not on them, an approach which has stood the test of time and is a traditional construct foundational to the CRIE model (Bowman, 2005, 2017). The process and preparation for working with Indigenous communities is as important as the theories and methods that underpin the work of the evaluator. Since 2005, this initial CRIE con- ceptual model has been implemented, tested, and modified through national and international IE studies (Bowman, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2015, 2017; Bowman et al., 2015; Bowman & Reinhardt, 2014, 2015; Garasky et al., 2016; O’Connor et al., 2015). Created from the Stockbridge-Munsee/Lunaape 10 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   traditional teachings, this CRIE evaluation model was developed using the Stockbridge-Munsee/ Lunaape’s medicine wheel (SML CRIE). Evaluation is situated around a four-part framework that is about process, content, context, and community. The model is not flat but multidimensional, incor- porating physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional aspects of evaluation. The SML CRIE model allows for adaptations for community context/building, cultural responsiveness/traditional teachings for solving issues, documenting strengths as well as needs or challenges, and flexibility to meet local and funder requirements for evidence-based evaluations. The SML CRIE evaluation model was conceptualized by Bowman (2005) and for over 13 years continues to be modified and updated based on applications, new culture and language teachings, and as Indigenous elders, academics, and community members guide the SML CRIE creator’s model (Bowman, 2006, 2016, 2018). Figure 2 illustrates the latest model. Other important Indigenous and Western theories and methods that can be used in the IE context include: � Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR): “CBPR is an orientation to research thatfocuses on relationships between academic and community partners, with principles of co- learning, mutual benefit, and long-term commitment and incorporates community theories, participation, and practices into the research efforts” (Wallerstein & Duran, 2006, p. 312). � Tribally Driven Participatory Research (TDPR): TDPR (Collaborative Research Center forAmerican Indian Health, 2015; Mackety, 2012; Mariella, Brown, Carter, & Verri, 2009; Martinez & Timeche, 2016; National Congress of the American Indians Policy Research Center & MSU Center for Native Health Partnerships, 2012) is a natural pathway from CBPR to a more culturally responsive and legally/politically accurate way to conduct research or evaluation. Not only is it community based but the unique aspects of tribal governance by sovereign Indigenous nations addresses the jurisdictional, treaty, and constitutional rights of tribes to govern themselves and any research or evaluation that pertains to them. In short, TDPR moves community-based research or evaluation from a passive to active stance in that research is “Tribally driven” versus Tribally based (Letendre & Caine, 2004). � Tribal Critical Theory (TCT): TCT builds on Critical Race Theory (CRT) frameworks ofexamining how political, legal, and other power relationships influence, reinforce, and sustain systemic and institutional racism and inequities (Delgado, 1989; Delgado & Stefancic, 2012; Figure 2. Culturally responsive indigenous evaluation model (Stockbridge-Munsee/Lunaape Framing) byBowman (2006, 2016) and Bowman and Dodge-Francis (2018). Waapalaneexkweew 11   Yosso, 2005). It deepens CRT theory by applying it to the distinct legal, political, historical, and cultural components that are uniquely tied to Indigenous people and tribal governments. Brayboy (2005) offers nine tenets that summarize TCT: colonization is endemic to society; U.S. policies toward Indigenous people are rooted in imperialism, White supremacy, and desire for material gain; Indigenous identity is both political and racial; Indigenous people have rights to tribal sovereignty, autonomy, self-determination, and self-identification; cul- ture, knowledge, and power have different meanings under Indigenous lenses; government and education policies for Indigenous people are linked to the problematic goal of assimila- tion; cultural traditions and philosophies are central to the lived realities, differences, and adaptability of Indigenous people; theories and stories are not separate but are legitimate sources of data and ways of being; and theory and practice are connected in deep and explicit ways so that scholars must work toward social change. � Decolonization and Indigenous Theory and Methods: Smith (2012) summarizes these as“concerned not so much with the actual technique of selecting a method but much more with the context in which research problems are conceptualized and designed, and with the implications of research for its participants and their communities” (p. ix). Decolonized and Indigenous methods call for replacing colonial methods and philosophies with original Indigenous teachings, culture, and language that have meaning, empowering effects, and positive impacts, thus “re-writing and re-righting” our history (Smith, 2012, p. 7). Yellow Bird (2007) and colleagues (Yellow Bird et al., 2007; Waziyatawin & Yellow Bird, 2005) also recognize the culture and the context including the social, political, and economic power that colonizers want to maintain or expand and how that historically and contem- porarily impacts Indigenous people’s lives. To combat the devastating impacts of coloniza- tion, one must decolonize the mind first by questioning the legitimacy of the colonizer and not accepting a role as a colonized person. This is achieved not only through critical thinking but also being grounded in Indigenous culture, community, and language (one’s own first, and then others). � The Tri-Lateral Model (TLM): Conceptually developed first by Reinhardt and Maday (2006),the TLM was used in an educational and policy context to frame, test, and modify the design, inclusion, and implementation of legal/political and cultural/community context components of studies. The TLM has also been used in research and evaluation studies (Bowman 2016, 2017; Garasky et al., 2016). Research, evaluation, and policy studies that include Indigenous populations span sectors and disciplines, requiring a systems road map for collaborative initiatives (Bowman, 2007; Bowman & Reinhardt, 2014, 2015, & 2016; Bowman et al., 2015; Garasky et al., 2016; O’Connor et al., 2015). When multiple governments (tribal, federal, and state) work together to develop and implement American Indian evaluation, research, and policy studies, using a tri-lateral governance framework provides a systems structure for these governments and their associated agencies or departments to work colla- boratively to carry out studies with Indigenous people. � Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP): UNDRIP (2008) is a framing ofIndigenous rights that, like other UN program focus areas (i.e., UN Women, EvalGender, etc.), could be developed into an evaluation model with handbooks, indicators, and methods for evaluating equality. The UNDRIP affirms that, “Indigenous peoples are equal to all other peoples, while recognizing the right of all peoples to be different, and to be respected as such” (p. 1) and includes 46 specific international articles that affirm the unique, historic, and legal human, governance, and collective rights of Indigenous peoples. Echo-Hawk (2013) provided a follow-up to UNDRIP and a call for its implementation, particularly in the United States and other countries with large Indigenous populations that did not affirm this declaration in 2007. The American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was developed by the 12 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   Organization of American States (2016) as a regional and comprehensive human rights instrument in support of the UNDRIP. Many Indigenous activists, scholars, and governments are using these international declarations as springboards to advocate for and create change and as the foundation to building case studies and empirical evidence around emerging and best practices in policy, research, and evaluation. On a personal level, the path toward IE can begin by recognizing all voices and seeing the Indigenous people right in our midst. The Indigenous story should be told in the United States as it has been in other countries (Commonwealth of Australia, 1997; Kiernan, 2002; Meierhenrich, 2014; Moses, 2000; Niezen, 2013; Reyher & Singh, 2010). In Democratic evaluation and democ- racy: Exploring the reality (Podems, 2017), the editor and contributors explore participants’ experi- ences with evaluation and how evaluation can contribute to or serve as a social justice lever for democracy—or not. Situated mostly outside of the United States, Podems and the contributors provide critical information about culture, context, and the lived experiences of communities and people who may or may not be the fortunate recipients of democracy in action in their lives. Evaluation, when framed with a social justice lens, offers this as a better way to create a just and equitable society. How can we in the evaluation community incorporate this narrative into our practice? As eva- luators within the AEA, we can push to elevate Indigenous voices and work to clarify, discuss openly, measure, and change impacts for improving our work with Indigenous communities and tribal governments. Examples of ways we can support this good work include past AEA initiatives such as the Graduate Education Diversity Internship Program (http://www.eval.org/gedi); the Cul- tural Reading of the AEA Program Evaluation Standards Task Force (http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/ fid¼74); the AEA Evaluation Policy Task Force (http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid¼129); the Minor-ity Serving Institute Fellowship (http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid¼230); EvalPartners Global Ini-tiative (http://evalpartners.org/); and the Cultural Competence (CC) in Evaluation Statement (http:// www.eval.org/ccstatement). Other recent AEA diversity activities include the 2016–2017 race and class dialog discussions (http://www.eval.org/page/racedialogues), national discussions to raise awareness and promote positive actions to address the racial, ethnic, and class disparities seen within the United States. A new Presidential Task Force on Member Engagement, Diversity, and Leadership Development (2017–present) is charged with reconstructing AEA institutional memory; reviewing and evaluating the current status of diversity initiatives, commitments, and plans (includ- ing the public statement on CC); and assessing newly proposed organizational, program, and indi- vidual indicators designed to keep engagement, diversity, and leadership development on the agenda of the AEA board. Finally, New Directions in Evaluation and the American Journal of Evaluation are publishing articles regarding race and diversity. Collectively, Indigenous people and organizations participated in most of these AEA activities at an individual level and occasionally at a program or an organizational level. Unfortunately, partic- ipation has been very low—the lowest among all racial/ethnic groups. There have been no formal and sustained partnerships and few sponsored initiatives between AEA and tribal governments, tribal nonprofits, or tribal colleges and universities on a systemic scale for much of the last three decades.4 The good news is that since 2016, we have seen new initiatives promoting higher levels of individual or organizational Indigenous participation with AEA. While AEA is working to reach out to Indigenous partners, it is clear that more sustained efforts, a formal strategic direction, and equitable resources should be dedicated to this most underrepresented population. Together, we can narrow gaps by collaborating on research and evaluation studies so more Indigenous populations are included. We can meet needs in a more culturally responsive way by developing the technical evaluation skills and competencies for IE through participation in trainings, courses, and mentoring on evaluation projects. And we can build and strengthen the capacities, infrastructure, and resource Waapalaneexkweew 13   supports through grant writing, targeted budget appropriations, and inclusion of Indigenous voices or tribal governments on boards or in key committee participation. Many of these strategies, if implemented long term, would provide for a more targeted organizational and strategic systems approach to engaging and including Indigenous populations, organizations, and tribal governments. How as a profession and association do we stop systemically reinforcing and recreating the racism that exists within evaluation and government policies and programs? We can start by including Indigenous academics, consulting with tribal governments, and designing studies with Indigenous theories, methods, and models. As part of the professional standard and procurement policies for governments, for profit agencies, and nonprofit organizations, we can create require- ments for including Indigenous academics and organizations in prominent positions and in signif- icant contracts for evaluation, policy, or research studies and related training and technical assistance contracts. We can develop contract language that includes community, culture, and Tribally based human subjects and intellectual property protections. Together, we can learn not only how to coexist but how to co-construct, cocreate, and copresent our findings in ways that are effective for funder and tribal participants and translational to the closest levels of use at the community level. The answers to our evaluation profession’s challenges, gaps, and dilemmas do not exist solely in the academy, a prominent keynote, or a national or international publication. Culturally responsive and scientifically rigorous contributions from Indigenous academics are also in peer-reviewed publications not often valued or promoted at mainstream conferences. Examples include the National Indian Education Association’s website, the National Congress of American Indian’s Policy Research Center Website, the Collaborative Research Center for American Indian Health, and the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network website. Hundreds of Indigenous evaluators can be accessed within AEA through the Indigenous Peoples in Evaluation Topical Interest Group and globally via EvalIndigenous. The countries participating in EvalIndigenous (a working group of EvalPartners) can also connect interested evaluators with hundreds of evaluators in their home countries. National and international organizations such as the National Congress of American Indians, United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Rights, American Indian Higher Education Consortium, and the Collaborative Center for American Indian Health can help evaluators better understand evaluation considerations within specific Indigenous venues, as can research universities and tribal colleges and universities such as Dine’ College, United Tribes Technical College, Haskell Indian Nations University, and the College of Menominee Nation. Native American-owned corpo- rations and nonprofits such as Tribal Tech, Masterkey Consulting, Bowman Performance Consult- ing, Native American Rights Fund, National Indian Education Association, Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, and Native Americans in Philanthropy also provide opportunities to build relations and engage Indigenous evaluators for those who make this a priority. Creating authentic relationships with other Indigenous agencies and people is important. Building purposeful academic, educational, and workforce pathways for the inclusion of tribal governments, Native nonprofits, tribal colleges and universities, native for profits and entrepreneurs through targeted and responsive outreach to include and link to Indigenous groups and initiatives will help strengthen the profession and associations of evaluation. Some examples of strategic inclusion in evaluation include EvalIndigenous (http://www.evalpartners.org/evalindigenous/about) via Eval- Partners, AEA’s Indigenous Peoples in Evaluation (http://comm.eval.org/aeaipetig/home), Alaska Evaluation Network (https://thealaskaevaluationnetwork.wildapricot.org/), the Hawaii/Pacific (https://h-pea.org/) Evaluation group, ANZEA in New Zealand (http://www.anzea.org.nz/), and the Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation (http://crea.education.illinois.edu/). Nonprofits such as the Anne E. Casey Foundation, WK Kellogg Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation all have building the pipeline and diversity in evaluation initiatives that are currently strategically 14 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   engaging culturally responsive and Indigenous evaluators. All these partners offer ways to further access and engage with other Indigenous and culturally responsive evaluators. Beyond the academy and institutions, evaluators can approach the communities themselves— who know the context best—for help. There are generations of Indigenous communities (rural, urban, rancheria, village, and reservations), tribal governments (567 in the United States alone), and traditional cultural leaders with strengths, competencies, resources, and knowledge that could help the field of evaluation and evaluators generally be more responsive and effective in document- ing evidence-based practices and models if we have the courage to approach them and humbly ask for guidance and assistance. Our challenge is to make culturally responsive and IE an area for our professional growth, as we would for any other evaluation subject matter area. Growth begins with academics and practitioners who are willing to step into the unknown, provide time and other resources, and be open to valuing knowledge that originates at the community level, asking for help as needed. Evaluation profes- sionals must understand and accept that capacity building and learning do not flow only from professionals and academics but are gifts that can be exchanged in both directions. Being aware of Native American academics and SMEs is not enough. Outreach and inclusion of these Native scholars and agencies will provide contextual and experiential learning essential to evaluators and the field of evaluation. Loowaneewang (Low-one-neh-wung)—Northern Door: Wisdom toGuide New Beginnings Lunaape Northern Door teachings (understanding and insight as things come full circle again). Northern Door teachings offer guidance for our individual professional evaluation practice and to the field of evaluation. As evaluators, once we recognize the extent of the structural racism in which evaluation is complicit, we can choose to become active participants in a transformative evaluation practice when working together with Indigenous people and Tribal governments. Consulting with Elders and ancestors who sit in the Northern door with their “White” hair, evaluators can use wisdom and lifetime experiences to build more responsive organizations and systemic supports for changing the way the business of evaluation is done with (not to or on) Indigenous peoples and Tribal governments. The first step we must take as individuals within an academic and evaluation community is being “woke” or aware and admitting there is a problem. In other words, we must begin to recognize and address the pain and anguish caused by assimilationist policies and colonized practices of the past and present so we can recognize and address it in our academic, policy, and programming activities (Goodkind, LaNoue, Lee, Freeland, & Freund, 2012; Hill, 2008; Sequist, Cullen, & Acton, 2011; Smith, 2012). This step is vital to changing outcomes for Indigenous populations that have remained virtually unchanged or worsened in the last century or more (Brave Heart, Chase, Elkins, & Altschul, 2011; Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Jones, 2006; Walker, 1999). As individuals, some evaluators also need to mourn and heal. Others need to trust, listen, and grow. And some may need to retire or find a new profession because they are causing trauma and harm through trivializing IE or through sheer political or economic greed related to grants and contracts in IE. As our mission and vision statement remind us, as members of the AEA, we all are responsible for a collective effort to address these wrongs, based upon the charge to be an inclusive, diverse, and effective organization as well as ethical, responsive, and professionally skilled and competent evalua- tors (American Evaluation Association, 2016). How can this be achieved? For individual evaluators, a first strategy is committing to reading one of the books or substantial resources suggested in this article. Reading one per year can build knowledge and transform aware- ness. Evaluators who prefer more frequent, shorter doses of information can join the Native Waapalaneexkweew 15   American organizations or the Indigenous Peoples in Evaluation Topical Interest Group (TIG) at AEA for access to free newsletters, regular updates through social media, and other resources. Moving beyond books, workshops, and lectures, actual engagement with Indigenous scholars, traditional scholars, and community members will help shape the practice individual evaluators read or learn about in training sessions or classrooms. The methods we use when working with Indigenous communities should be guided by the fact that Indigenous people belong to sovereign nations with inherent legal and political rights afforded to no other racial or ethnic group. Thus, consideration and respect for Indigenous communities is a priority. Appropriate methods include using tribal IRBs, or inquiring if there are tribal colleges or universities that can monitor for human and cultural protections. Culturally responsive evaluators can cocreate shared data agreements and colead studies with Indigenous scholars and provide accountability checks by pointing out when Western or mainstream agencies are not incorporating Indigenous methods and policies. These Indigenous theories, methods, and frameworks (legal and evaluative) will naturally support the cultural, linguistic, and community context that also should be incorporated into an evaluation study. Evaluation design should be purposeful in financial and policy strategies as well as generous with resources and supports. This means designing bids with diversity and Indigenous experts in mind and including Indigenous evaluators and Tribal Nations or tribal national nonprofits as authentic partners and co-primary investigators (PIs) in wider scale diversity initiatives and as participants at the table for creating systems changes with state, national, and international government agencies. For instance, evaluators should be aware of receiving extra points on a bid when Indigenous evaluators and authentic tribal partners are included. Ideally, engaging Indigenous SMEs and orga- nizations would be required when working with Indigenous people and whenever possible, Indi- genous contributors would lead such studies. Appropriate compensation for subject matter area experts is also important; evaluation should value all SMEs, not just those from the majority and privileged populations. Authoring with Indigenous communities and academics is another way to engage and give back to Indigenous populations. Creating useful work products beyond conventionally published articles that can stay in the community and provide value (e.g., briefing papers, data warehouses, and protocol development) is another strategy for successful sharing and co-ownership of projects and data. Equal access, participation in high-profile initiatives, inclusion on policy and leadership activities, and as partnership for training events are all concrete ways AEA and the field of evalua- tion can include Tribal Nations and Indigenous scholars and practitioners. As members of the greater evaluation community, evaluators should review, engage in critical dialog, and revise public statements by AEA or other organizations; become involved in diversity initiatives through the association or the other nonprofit partners discussed above; and critically review the membership on evidence-based policy, journal review, and elected leadership boards at AEA, on key national or international work groups, or at their home organization. Are these statements, organizations, and groups living up to their charge or purpose? Are they truly represen- tative of diversity and inclusive of Indigenous people and tribal governments? Collective voices and critical but constructive dialog will move the evaluation community forward. The evaluation profession needs to be purposeful and strategic in its efforts to acquire the professional skills and association capacities for IE with tribal community members and sovereign tribal governments. More presentations, publications, presidential strands, and keynotes at AEA’s annual or summer professional development offerings can highlight collaborative, effective, and responsive case studies. The profession must also be proactive, recognizing that it is not Indigenous people’s responsibility to educate practitioners. Evaluators must actively seek out knowledge and request wisdom as well as develop real scientific literacy and technical competencies, knowledge, and skills needed to carry out this work well. 16 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   Seeking out knowledge is not sufficient if that knowledge is not shared with the wider profession. In order for IE processes to be better understood and incorporated into practice, this responsive IE work must become part of the normal, everyday, standard discourse in individual professional practices, within the cultures of the organizations where evaluators work, within academia and in professional associations. It is important as an evaluation profession and association that we colla- boratively and with permission from our Indigenous partners, actively and purposefully document data, best practices, and methods for building responsive and responsible policies, programs, and systems to support transformative and sustained changes. Indigenous resources, publications, and prominent presentations (plenaries, presidential sessions, and live streaming events) must be included in the mainstream evaluation agenda to keep Indigenous concerns at the forefront of social and academic discourse. Archiving and making these publications and other resources free and publicly available is essential to this effort. Finally, from a global perspective, evaluation must continue to support and build upon the work being done by EvalPartners and EvalIndigenous using the 2020 agenda and incorporating the principles espoused by the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People (United Nations, 2008). Echo-Hawk (2013) and Kukutai and Taylor (2016) provide concrete suggestions for building UNDRIP’s evidence base and making Indigenous data collection, research, and evaluation a sover- eign and self-determined effort, truly building a pathway to achieving Indigenous self-sufficiency. Conclusion When evaluation with Indigenous communities is done collaboratively, responsively, and respect- fully, evaluators can change not only our own practice and profession but also the lives of Indigen- ous people and communities. Drawing parallels between the Indigenous and Western worlds is imperative to engaging non-Indigenous evaluators in a deeper and more transformative way and is already is being done through CBPR, participatory and empowerment evaluation, systems eva- luation, and developmental and utilization–focused evaluations, to name several. Someday, perhaps using Western and IE methods together will become a more common and blended practice, not a separate and additional step of the evaluative process. As a humble caretaker of Indigenous knowledge about evaluation, I give this article as an offering, that as evaluators, we may become more self-aware, able to change professional practice, and ultimately begin to heal and reverse the effects of colonialism on Indigenous people and Tribal Nations. We must continue to ask, “Are we putting the highest burden of responsibility on those least in power, with the fewest resources, lowest capacities, and with the highest needs to create systemic and sustainable change?” (italics added for emphasis). It is the evaluation profession’s collective responsibility—not just the Indigenous or evaluator of color’s responsibility—to live the mission and vision of our professional associations by holding each other accountable, so we can improve ourselves and our broader community(ies) of practice. Social justice change begins with us. Without an explicit commitment and dedication to change, the evaluation profession will continue to contribute to and proliferate structural injustices and inequalities—no longer through ignorance, but by choice. I humbly but directly ask my colleagues within the profession to purposefully, thoughtfully, and actively dedicate our resources to reverse the historic and current impact of structural racism on Indigenous populations, by building the skills, knowledge, abilities, and capacities to evaluate in Indigenous contexts and with Indigenous parti- cipants and tribal governments. Together, we can improve evaluation practice and our profession, one project or conference or initiative at a time. Collectively, we can advocate within our work- places, networks, professional organizations, and systemically across the broader field of evaluation for the rights of Indigenous people and Tribal Nations.

This is the forced removal of my family and tribal ancestors from our tribal homelands in the north and east to our current Reservation in Wisconsin. 18 American Journal of Evaluation XX(X)   Appendix B Summary of Tribal/U.S. Relations A brief summary of tribal/U.S. relations includes the following key events and eras (Pevar, 2012): � Pre-1494: the “Precontact” Era in what is now called the United States.� 1492–1787: Tribal independence. Hundreds (oral history says thousands) of sovereign Tribal Nations existed in what is now called North America. � 1787: the U.S. Constitution established America’s national government and fundamentallaws, guaranteeing certain basic rights for its citizens. � 1787–1828: agreements between “equals.” Negotiated treaties between individual sovereignTribal Nations and the United States established borders and prescribed behavior between the parties, predicated upon the inherent right of Tribes to govern their people as sovereign nations. � 1832–1871: American Indian nations considered domestic, dependent Tribes. Negotiatedtreaties between Tribes and the United States had to be approved by Congress (National Archives, 2016). � 1871: the U.S. House of Representatives stopped recognizing individual Tribes within theUnited States as independent nations with whom the United States could establish treaties. � 1887–1934: The Allotment and Assimilation Era continued forced removal of sovereignTribes from lands coveted by White settlers. Forced assimilation and education of Indigenous people was instituted; this included separating families and imposing severe punishments for speaking Native language or practicing culture in an effort to civilize Indigenous people or “kill the Indian and save the man” (“Capt. Richard H. Pratt on the Education of Native Americans,” n.d.). � 1934–1953, Indian Reorganization Era (IRE). Federal policy toward Indigenous peopleadopted a more humane approach following the Merriam Report of 1928 (Meriam, 1928). Federal policy allowing restoration of tribal independence was supported under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. � 1953–1968, the Termination Era. The Hoover Commission (Lederle, 1949) called for com-plete integration of Indigenous people into White society, fostering several important pieces of legislation. � U.S. House Resolution 108 terminated the federal government’s trust relationship withIndian Tribes. All federal benefits, resources, and programming/support services were terminated, tribes were no longer considered “wards of the state,” and U.S./tribal trust relationships were ended (H. R. Con. Res.108, 1953). During this time frame, 109 tribes were terminated; additionally, many tribes vanished or disbanded, and many reservations were abolished. � Public Law 280 gave six states (Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, andWisconsin) criminal jurisdiction over Indian reservations (Indian Relocation Act of 1956; Public Law 83–280; Pevar, 2012, p. 12). PL280 virtually eliminated federal justice law and resources, confusing matters between state, tribal, and federal governments, creating a jurisdictional “black hole” around crime and victims of crime in Indian Country. (Tribal Law and Policy Institute, n.d.). � The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 (Pub. L. 959) prompted many Indigenous tribalmembers (including my father, grandfather, and uncles) to leave reservations to work on job programs in urban areas because there was no economic development on reserva- tions given the abrupt termination policies of this era. � 1968–Present, Indigenous self-determination, survival, and resistance: As part of the civilrights movement, tribal governments and Indigenous people worked hard to restore their Waapalaneexkweew 19   communities, their families, and their lives. Tribes asserted their sovereignty, resulting in many positive policy and program changes in education, economic development, health, justice, and human services (Bowman, 2015; Champagne, 1997; Cornell & Kalt, 2010; National Congress of American Indians, n.d.).

This is a direct result of the growingnumber of Indigenous evaluators in the field; the increased access and oppor-tunities for Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners collaborating on evalua-tion projects and academic initiatives; and changes in policy, programming, andfunding that better support CR and/or culturally responsive indigenous evalu-ation (CRIE) initiatives. This chapter examines four overarching content sum-mary areas for CRIE: historical and legal foundations; design approaches; ap-plication; and practical CRIE strategies for strengthening professional practiceand building evaluation industry capacities for CRIE. © 2018 Wiley Periodi-cals, Inc., and the American Evaluation Association.

To do so, we call upon the Lunaape (Mun-see)/Mohican medicine wheel framework to structure the content of thisarticle (Grumet, 2002). We focus on the U.S. context, but suggest consid-eration for Indigenous evaluation practice globally. Ktanaxkihlaak (Kah-taw-nah-x-kee-lock)—Eastern Door. This door is aboutour origin story and beginnings. We situate Indigenous evaluation withina broader historical and legal context as a starting place for collectiveawareness of our histories. Shaawaneewang (Shaw-one-neh-wung)—Southern Door. This door is aboutbalanced development and Indigenous contributions. We summarize crit-ical theories and methods that contribute to the field of Indigenous eval-uation and then present the CRIE evaluation model. Wsihkaang (wh-see-kong)—Western Door. This door is about perseveranceand unknown potentiality. We share a CRIE case study that is culturallyresponsive, scientifically rigorous, and includes the legal/political aspectsof Tribes. Loowaneewang (Low-one-neh-wung)—Northern Door. This door is about el-der wisdom to guide new beginnings. We offer guidance for our profes-sional evaluation practice and broadly to the field of evaluation. Ktanaxkihlaak (Kah-taw-nah-x-kee-lock)—Eastern Door:Origin Story and Beginnings The federal government of the United States recognizes 573 American In-dian and Alaska Native Tribes and villages (Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA],2016). Prior to European contact, Indigenous populations lived all over 1 When possible, we chose to use the word Indigenous for describing ourselves, others,or a community of the First Inhabitants of this land but recognize the cultural, linguis-tic, and governance diversity of Tribal people and Nations. As Linda Smith (2012) notes,the term “Indigenous” has historic resonance, “Indigenous peoples is a 1970s term fromthe American Indian Movement to internationalize experiences of Indigenous peoplesaround Mother Earth . . . it represents our collective voices to finish the unfinished busi-ness of decolonization” (p. 7). Also, when possible and appropriate, we choose to useour Lunaape (Delaware) or Moh-he-con-nuk (Mohican) language (Waapalaneexkweew[Nicole Bowman]), Oneida or Menominee (Carolee Dodge-Francis), other Tribal lan-guages, or Indigenous terms within this article. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INDIGENOUS EVALUATION AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS 19 in balance with other Indigenous communities, Mother Earth, and all thewater, land, and sky inhabitants. Living as caretakers of Turtle Island (not“owners” of it) provided ancient guidance that allowed for all forms of lifeto live in natural equilibrium with each other. We begin with a high-leveloverview of Indigenous people’s historical experiences and Tribal nations’legal treaty and contemporary constitutional rights as the original peoplesof North America. This legal and political foundation, coupled with thecultural content and community contexts of Indigenous communities andTribal nations, is critical for the global field of evaluation and practicingevaluators designing and implementing evaluation studies with Indigenouspopulations (urban, rural, Reservation, or international). Each Tribal com-munity is different, and each will have a unique historical narrative, culturaltraditions, language, community practices, and political, legal, and gover-nance structures. Briefly, the impacts of Colonial or non-Tribal people on Indigenouspeople in the United States can be summarized in three eras: The Pre-Contact Era (before 1492 and European or Colonial contact to Turtle Island,now known as North America); the Early Colonial Contact Era (1492–1786known as the Treaty); and the United States Constitutional Era (1787 topresent). For brevity, the focus here is on the last era. This provides anoverview of the historical context that we are currently in (ConstitutionalEra), which has contemporary implications for the field of evaluation, eval-uation policy, and governance evaluation and policy between Tribal Nationsand other sovereign countries, including the United States. (For detailedinformation about all three eras, see Waapalaneexkweew [Bowman, forth-coming]). Beginning in 1787, the government of the United States conducted re-lations and made treaty agreements with Tribal nations through treatiesthat had to be approved by the U.S. Congress (National Archives, 2016).Treaties were “contracts among nations” (BIA, 2016) in which Tribes gaveup millions of acres of their homelands and vast natural resources to theUnited States in exchange for protections and maintenance of the healthand livelihood of Indigenous peoples and communities. Treaties were con-sidered the supreme law of the land and were predicated on the inherentright of the Tribes to govern their own people as sovereign nations (Pevar,2012). Treaties became the foundation of federal Indian law and the federalIndian trust relationship with the United States (BIA, 2016). In total, noneof the 384 treaties (Kappler, 1904) were kept despite being the contempo-rary basis for Indian law between sovereign governments (that is, the U.S.government and 573 individual Tribal governments in the United States). Tribal nations have a unique government-to-government status withthe United States and possess a nationhood status that retains their in-herent powers of self-government (Ball, 2000). A Tribe’s inherent rightsof sovereignty and treaty rights are protected by the U.S. Constitutionunder the Supremacy Clause, and further embedded within the trust NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   20 INDIGENOUS EVALUATION relationship and subsequent legislation (Reinhardt, 2008). Federal Indiantrust responsibility is legally enforceable as a fiduciary obligation and dutythat the United States must uphold to protect Tribal rights related to land,education, resources, economies, health, and other quality of life aspects. Sovereignty applies across many Indigenous communities, contexts,sectors, and disciplines (Barker, 2005; Cram, 2005)—including evaluation.In fact, sovereignty is considered so foundational that most legal scholarsconsider sovereignty the “single most important legal right that Indianshave and if Indians lost this right it would be difficult, if not impossible, toprotect any of their other rights” (Pevar, 2008, p. 1; Jorgensen, 2007; Pevar,2002). The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People(UNDRIP) also calls for addressing the minimum standards for the survival,dignity, and well-being of the Indigenous peoples of the world (United Na-tions, 2008), as does the recently developed American Declaration on In-digenous Peoples Rights (Organization of American States, 2016). Respect for the legal ramifications of Tribal sovereignty is a criticalaspect of any professional or academic pursuit undertaken in Indiancountry. Unfortunately, for many Tribal communities and governments,evaluation has not been an equal, collaborative, or value-added process(Anderson et al., 2012). Few evaluation publications address the coreissues that have the highest impact for Tribal communities, such assovereignty, self-determination, and decolonization within the context ofan evaluation study. Bowman (2006, forthcoming), demonstrated the lackof capacity of non-Indian funding agencies to meet the legal, cultural,and contextual requirements of Tribal governments when conducting“multijurisdictional” research and evaluation studies. Even the synthesisof the literature by governance evaluation “experts” (Schoenfeld & Jordan,2017) omits sovereign Indigenous governments despite their recognitionby over 144 countries that signed the UNDRIP (United Nations, 2008).Combining culturally responsive evaluation (CRE) and sovereignty issueswill begin to address the lack of attention to this area. Shaawaneewang (Shaw-one-neh-wung)—Southern Door:Balanced Development and Indigenous Contributions Indigenous peoples have different experiences and origin stories related toevaluation. Though we have spoken with many elders, none has yet sharedwith us an Indigenous word that translates to the English term “evalu-ate.” When we seek wisdom about Indigenous evaluation from our elders,what is most often heard are concepts, teachings, and stories about life ordeath. If our ancestors did not assess or evaluate a situation, length of aseason, food supply, and so on, it could literally mean life or death. Interms of evaluation, our elders tell us that it is a way of understandingthe world, “something that happens is not good or bad, it just is and wehave an opportunity to learn from it” (Chohkalihke [G. Jacobs], personal NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INDIGENOUS EVALUATION AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS 21 communication, July 2015). This section shares a brief history and situatesCRIE within the field of CRE. Through professional and community experi-ence from our “elders,” the authors share the development and methods ofa self-determined, emergent model for evaluation, namely the CRIE model. CRE arose in the early 1970s and is influenced by responsive evaluation(Stake, 1972) and culturally responsive pedagogy and curriculum effortsprevalent in the 1980s and 1990s (Center for Culturally Responsive Eval-uation and Assessment [CREA], 2016; Hood, Hopson, & Frierson, 2005).CRE explores a decentralized, contextualized, transformative, and respon-sive evaluation model where social justice and evaluation meet. CRE usesevaluation theories and collaborative methods, study designs, and sharingof study findings to locally situate and study issues of importance to com-munity members and stakeholders who are most impacted by the evaluation(Stake, 1972) or those who have the most at stake in the evaluation results,including underrepresented and vulnerable populations (Hood, Hopson, &Frierson, 2005, 2015; Hood, Hopson, & Kirkhart, 2015). Traditionally wewould honor and call CRE our family or laan = gómeew (related to, ourrelative) because of the welcoming place they have created for us as Indige-nous evaluators, and the way they value Indigenous evaluation in all ourrich diversity as vital contributors to the field of evaluation. Second, Tribally Driven Participatory Research (TDPR) expanded thefield by exploring research where culture, context, and political/legalsovereignty is central to the research being conducted in Indian country(Collaborative Research Center for American Indian Health [CRCAIH],2015; National Congress of the American Indians [NCAI], 2012; Mariella,Brown, Carter, & Verri, 2009; Jernigan, Jacob, & Styne, 2015). In this case,the end results were congruent to the process. TDPR moves community-based research or evaluation from a passive to active stance in that researchis “Tribally driven” versus “Tribally based” (Letendre & Caine, 2004). Third, the trilateral model (TLM) (Reinhardt & Maday, 2006) is a de-colonized and indigenous-centered way used to situate Tribal sovereigntyto frame, test, and modify the design, inclusion, and implementation of le-gal/political aspects and cultural/community context of Indigenous com-munities and Tribal governments. When multiple governments (Tribal, fed-eral, state, and so on) work together to develop and implement AmericanIndian evaluation, research, and policy studies, the use of a trilateral frame-work provides a structure for these governments and their associated agen-cies or departments to work collaboratively to carry out studies with In-digenous people. Last, the other “relatives” contributing to our growth and practice inIndigenous communities include critical race theory (CRT) (Darder, Tor-res, & Baltodano, 2009; Delgado & Stefancic, 2001); Tribal critical theory,which builds on the CRT framework by applying it to the distinct legal,political, historical, and cultural components that are uniquely tied to In-digenous people and Tribal governments (Brayboy, 2005; Pulitano, 2003); NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   22 INDIGENOUS EVALUATION and decolonization and Indigenous theory and methods (Smith, 2012; Wil-son & Yellowbird, 2005; Kovach, 2010). Succinctly, CRIE and culturally responsive (CR) research, evaluation,and policy studies work well together to include Indigenous populationsthat span across sectors and disciplines, and which often require a systemsroadmap for academic studies and initiatives. (Bowman, 2007; Bowman &Reinhardt, 2014, 2015, 2016; Bowman, Dodge-Francis, & Tyndall, 2015;Garasky et al., 2016; O’Connor et al., 2015). An Emerging Model: Culturally Responsive IndigenousEvaluation CRIE is situated within and as a partner to CRE. CRIE’s contemporary eval-uation origins are found in publications as early as the 1960s, with roots inpublic health and public policy administration (Hutchinson, 1960; Such-man, 1967). CRIE began as a practical method and strategies used to includeculture, language, community context, and sovereign Tribal governancewhen conducting research, policy, and evaluation studies (Bowman, 2006).After nearly a decade of cultural and linguistic growth, development andapplication of CRIE strategies, the CRIE model was developed and testedas an emerging evaluation framework (Bowman & Cram, 2014; Bowman,Dodge-Francis, & Tyndall, 2015; Bowman, 2017a). CRIE uses traditionalknowledge and contemporary Indigenous theory and methods to designand implement an evaluation study, so it is led by and for the benefit of In-digenous people and Tribal nations. The CRIE model2 was created as a flexi-ble, four-part framework. This model allows for adaptations for communitycontext/building community, cultural responsiveness/traditional teachingsfor solving issues, documenting strengths as well as needs or challenges,and flexibility to meet local and funder requirements for evidence-basedevaluations (see Table 1.1 below). Wsihkaang (wh-see-kong)—Western Door: Perseverance andUnknown Potentiality From the western direction, we apply the CRIE model to a case study.In 2014, Bowman Performance Consulting (BPC) participated in a feder-ally driven team charged with evaluating the capacity of Tribal govern-ments and Indigenous communities in the United States to administer theirown food and nutrition assistance programs. Stakeholders included Tribalgovernment representatives, federal nutrition representatives, and the 2 The initial development and evolution of the CRIE model are by Waapalaneexkweew(Nicole Bowman) as given per traditional teachings and responsibilities through theStockbridge Munsee/Mohican elders and traditional culture/language teachers (2003–2017).

The study had four ob-jectives: 1. Identify services, functions, and activities associated with administer-ing nutrition assistance programs. 2. Consult with Indian Tribal organizations (ITOs) to determine the ex-tent of their interest in administering these programs. 3. Understand the readiness of ITOs to administer these programs basedon the services, functions, and activities associated with administeringall or part of these programs. 4. Identify statutory or regulatory changes, waivers, or special provisionsthat would be needed for ITOs to administer each nutrition program. The project team employed a multimethod and culturally responsivedesign that included document reviews, consultations with official Tribalgovernment representatives, additional outreach to Tribal leaders and pro-gram staff, a survey of Tribes, and site visits. The methodology was basedon an exploratory case study design as defined by Yin (2003); investigatinga contemporary phenomenon within a real-life context while using bothquantitative and qualitative measurements. CRIE strategies were used toselect theory/methods, prepare the evaluation team, design and implementthe study, and present findings. 3 A Prime refers to the “Prime contractor” who is directly responsible and signs a contractfor work with the Federal government. Subcontractors hold contracts directly with thePrime, not the Federal government. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   24 INDIGENOUS EVALUATION Indigenous Theory and Methods as the Foundation of the Study BPC and the Prime conceptualized and purposefully developed the pro-curement narrative (bid), created the study design, co-constructed internaltrainings to prepare twenty-six Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers,and had continuous monitoring, member checking, feedback, and qualityassurance loops from start to finish using a TDPR and CDPR approachthroughout the study. The project team involved Tribal stakeholders inguiding study activity whenever possible, for example, in planning withthe internal team and externally through early stakeholder discussions.Their expertise assisted and informed the study process and implementa-tion throughout the 15 months of the study. Collaborative planning began with the review of key documents,project roll out discussions with the federal program officers and the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB), and initial conversations and consul-tations with Tribal governments and the federal Office of Tribal Research(OTR). It should be noted that early teleconference calls with Tribal gov-ernment participants held a note of angst, as some of them wanted moreformal Tribal consultation guarantees, as sovereign Tribal governments areafforded under current law. However, this concern subsided once it wasknown that an American Indian company would play an integral role withinthe process, that there would be many opportunities for feedback online andthrough face-to-face outreach efforts, and that OTR and other Indigenousstakeholders (that is, NCAI) would be advisory partners throughout thestudy. BPC Indigenous Centered Training A critical element was acquainting non-Indigenous project team memberswith the often-troubled history of evaluation and research with Indigenouspopulations, explaining the concepts of Tribal sovereignty, and providingcontextualized perspectives that were culturally unique to each commu-nity we surveyed or visited. The twenty-seven member research team re-ceived training in this approach from subject matter experts, themselvesTribal members, who were partners in the study along with ongoing em-bedded conversations throughout the entire study from design throughreporting. After many weeks of development, BPC and the Prime createdan internal training curriculum for the project team. This was sufficientlyresourced and left to the lead evaluation team members (Indigenous andnon-Indigenous) to design. Pre-reading materials were given to the train-ing participants a week in advance and a full day online and interactive we-binar training was provided to cover CBPR, TDPR, Tribal governance andsovereignty, an overview of the historical and cultural aspects of Indigenouspopulations, governance and operational differences of Tribes and Tribalnonprofits, and human, cultural, and intellectual property protections viaTribal IRBs. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INDIGENOUS EVALUATION AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS 25 Following the training, two group webinar meetings were held to dis-cuss impacts of training, to answer any lingering questions, and to furtherprepare non-Indigenous team members for conducting site visits. Pre- andpost-site visit meetings were conducted with evaluation team members toprepare for working with each Indigenous community where data was col-lected. Feedback indicated that the entire study team felt the training wascritical to the evaluation. Co-development of Study Protocols and Documents Whenever possible, the team asked Tribal stakeholders for help in guidingthe activities, for example, in the development of study tools. The projectteam built in multiple ways to receive varied and diverse stakeholder feed-back throughout the study design, testing, and full data collection process,which included meeting documents; and formal administrative responses ofthe project team to key Federal and Tribal stakeholders including produc-tion and dissemination of the final report (Garasky et al., 2016). Ensuringthat the Indigenous research team members and study participants had am-ple opportunities to provide feedback on cleaned or summarized data, draftfindings, and final sections of the published USDA FNS study report wasessential. The instruments, protocols, and ongoing internal and external discus-sion and feedback loops were used for project monitoring and modifica-tion. They also functioned as learning tools for the study team and fundersto learn about evaluation and study process needed to produce a valid, re-liable, and accurate account of the Indigenous perspectives regarding theinterest, capacities, and benefits/barriers to Tribal administration of federalnutrition assistance programs. The final report included syntheses, editing,technical writing, and inclusion of Indigenous scholars from the BPC teamwho were documented as contributing authors of this congressionally man-dated study. Site Visit Structure and Study Closing Processes Site visits were simultaneously conducted with Tribal leaders of sixteenTribal communities or organizations concurrently with documentation de-velopment and survey deployment and data collection. Thirteen site visitswere completed, during which the team members spoke with more thaneighty participants from sixteen federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Na-tive villages. It was mandatory that each site visit had at least one Tribalrepresentative, either from the BPC team or from the Tribal representativeparticipant pool. An essential component of the site visits was the teamdebrief immediately after the site visit discussions. During debriefs, Tribalroles, terminology, or cultural components were discussed and explained tonon-Native team members. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   26 INDIGENOUS EVALUATION The report was completed in February 2016 and shared at a federalcloseout meeting in spring 2016. At this meeting and thereafter, the in-ternal report was shared with federal and Tribal stakeholders for feedbackbefore its publication in June 2016. Since study was finished, there havebeen several activities informally that continue the work of the FNS project.Members of the initial project study team (Indigenous and non-Indigenous)have debriefed outside of the project, shared their experiences and whatthey learned, and have provided some initial feedback and perspective tothe academic community through evaluation activities (Bowman & Cham-berlain, 2015). In summary the study was successful in academic, community context,and cultural ways because of the pre-existing relationships, networks, con-text expertise, and a working understanding (i.e. practical implementationusing the theories, methods, and knowledge beyond just reading about it)of how to behave and conduct studies in diverse Indigenous contexts (rural,Reservation or Tribal Nation, urban, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native).The value-added team that BPC brought to the Prime contractor allowedthe scientific and technical process of conducting this academic study tobe strengthened; used the entire project and all the aspects (contracting,training internally, theory and method selection, development of design andinstruments, data collection and reporting, and so on) as continuous andapplied learning opportunities to build the capacities of non-Native and/ornon-experienced academics and public agencies to grow; and resulted inTribal nations and Indigenous communities from diverse geographic loca-tions having a culturally responsive, community relevant, and scientificallyrigorous evaluation experience with a multiethnic study team. Without In-digenous academics leading or co-leading this project, the study design,findings, and experiences would have been completely different. This iswhy true collaboration, with purposeful selection and adequate resourc-ing of Indigenous academics who equally participate as co-PI’s, is critical tochanging the way we work as evaluators. In short, if we change the front-end way we do academic studies (inputs, resources, supports, and so on) tobe more culturally responsive, then the rest of the study activities are mostlikely to produce different and more valid results (outputs, outcomes, andimpacts) that have the highest potential for transforming practice, policies,and programming. CRIE is one model to help us consider how we can dothings differently, regardless of our sector or discipline. Loowaneewang (Low-one-neh-wung)—Northern Door: ElderWisdom to Guide New Beginnings Indigenous evaluation was not seen in the literature until the 1960s, mainlyregarding public health evaluations (Hogan, 2007). The current evaluationpractitioners or the “founding fathers” or “pioneers” in evaluation (DobkinHall, 2004; Hogan, 2007; Williams, 2016, p. 7), have provided models NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INDIGENOUS EVALUATION AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS 27 (Stufflebeam, 2001) that synthesize evaluation; these are further catego-rized in an evaluation theory tree of development demonstrating how thefield has matured or evolved over the years (Alkin, 2004, 2012; Cardin &Alkin, 2012), but few include Indigenous authors let alone Tribal govern-ment considerations for evaluation (Schoenfeld & Jordan, 2017). The lastfew years has begun to illustrate a wider representation of Indigenous voiceswithin the broader field of academia including data sovereignty and Tribalprotections and governance in Tribal and non-Tribal research and evalua-tion initiatives (Bowman, 2015, 2016, 2017; NCAI, 2016; NCAI and MSU,2012; University of Arizona, 2017). To broaden and strengthen these new tenets within evaluation, the firststep involves continued dialogue and understanding that “we don’t knowall” and “need to listen more, talk less” (that is, be the catalyst to dialoguenot the inquisition). The academic and evaluation community can moveforward through understanding that there exist multiple ways of thinking,processing, and applying evaluation methods. In other words, we must be-gin to recognize that the ills of history are not discrete entities but consist ofculminating experiences that impact Tribal people and communities. Thesefactors must be integrated into our academic, policy, and programming ac-tivities to jointly address devastating outcomes and policy/programminggaps (Seaquist, Cullen, & Acton, 2011; Hill, 2008; Jones, 2006). We viewthis as vital to changing outcomes for Indigenous populations that haveremained virtually unchanged or worsened in the last century or more de-spite the policies and legal frameworks that have been available to improveconditions and impacts of Indigenous people and communities (Bowman,2017; Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Walker, 1999). The ability to include culture, language, community, and contextwithin Indigenous populations and nations in evaluation goes far beyondsimple inclusions or framing. Indigenous people belong to sovereign na-tions with inherent legal and political rights afforded to no other racial orethnic group. Sovereignty must be respected (that is, utilizing Tribal IRBsand Tribal Council for study approval), and Tribal governments involved inour evaluation, policy, and political discourse. This requires scientific, cul-tural, legal, and governance competencies and skills by evaluators. To doless than this is marginalizing Indigenous people and Tribal nations, caus-ing further trauma and harm, and demonstrates the technical deficienciesof the evaluation profession. Conclusion Evaluation should be a tool of transformation, improvement, and empower-ment to solve chronic issues in society. Inclusion of Indigenous theories andmethods, Tribal governments, and Indigenous people (as academics, com-munity members, leaders, policy makers, and elders or traditional people)needs to be at the front end of this process, not an afterthought. We must NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION • DOI: 10.1002/ev   28 INDIGENOUS EVALUATION work together in an orchestrated effort to create a new evaluation paradigm,to expand the continuation of Indigenous populations at all strategic pointswithin “evidence-based evaluation” and to put funding agencies, policymakers, and academics on notice that this step is not a suggestion but afundamental necessity in creating the new North. The good news is that the Indigenous resources and strategies outlinedearlier are building blocks that pair well with many western foundations ofevaluation (for example, community-based participatory research, criticaltheories, and transformative, utilization-focused, developmental, authen-tic, democratic, and empowerment evaluations) when done correctly, re-sponsively, responsibly, and collaboratively. Drawing parallels between theIndigenous and western worlds is imperative to engaging non-Indigenousevaluators in a deeper and more transformative way. By using Western andIndigenous evaluation methods together as a truly blended practice and nota separate or after thought to the evaluative process, the expansion of eval-uation partnerships, methods, and outcomes will be accomplished.

Additionally, the cultural and linguistic components of Indig- enous contexts vary greatly across communities where program evaluations are being conducted. Through a contemporary case example, the authors provide a framework for co-constructing a culturally responsive evaluation design and describe practical strategies for evaluating a federally funded program implemented within a Tribal government reservation context. Im- plications for replicating future culturally responsive evaluations are shared to move toward building a larger body of empirical studies guided by Indig- enous evaluation frameworks, theories, and formal policies (i.e., the United Nations Declaration of Indigenous Rights).   Understanding Indigenous1 culture and contexts is critically important in developing an effective Indigenous evaluation or research design. Aware- ness of diversity within and across Indigenous communities, understanding of the unique cultural and traditional norms, and ability to navigate the various contexts in which an Indigenous evaluation is carried out all con- tribute to successful research and evaluation. These contexts include the intersection of multiple legal jurisdictions across federal, state, and Tribal governments based on funding source(s) and implementation site(s). Too often, the absence and exclusion of Indigenous epistemologies, frame- works, methodologies, communities, and other resources from Western or mainstream academic research significantly contributes to gaps in policy, programming, and intended outcomes for Indigenous people.  Indigenous research conducted by Indigenous or non-Indigenous scholars mustbeethical,culturallysensitive(Tillman,2002)andappropriateforthe communities where the research is conducted (Grande, 2004; Hood, Hop- son, & Frierson, 2005; Kovach, 2010; LaFrance & Nichols, 2009; LaFrance, Nichols, & Kirkhart, 2012; Oakes, Riewe, Edmunds, Dubois, & Wilde, 2003; Smith, 2012). By including culture and context in a study’s design, researchers and evaluators create a rigorous and responsive method (Hood et al., 2005), which increases opportunities for documenting the truth, allows for authentic participation of a wide variety of stakeholders, and increases the multicultural validity of a study (Kirkhart 1995a, 1995b, 2005; LaFrance et al., 2012).  Understanding historical context in this field is essential: researchers must acknowledge and address the dynamics of power (Gitlin, 1994) and disempowerment when creating research or evaluation studies conducted with Indigenous people. Prior to European contact, Indigenous people inhabiting North America used their own systems of self-governance to sustain high levels of health, education, social, and community welfare of Tribal people. Each tribe was unique in its culture; customs, worldview, tra- ditions, and other teachings were grounded in a way of life that was distinct to each particular tribe. From Tribal histories, documents, and other In- digenous artifacts, we understand that life was not merely maintained, but Indian people thrived prior to European contact. Tribes met the needs of    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  337 �    their people through a blend of self-governance and cultural traditions in which the community members participated and provided accountability.  European contact forced North American tribes from their ancestral homelands, destroyed their communities (culturally and literally), and forced assimilation to a European way of life that is now considered mainstream North American culture. As centuries passed, tribes made treaty agreements with the federal government in which they gave up lands and other resources; in return, the federal government was to provide for their health, education, and general welfare. Eventually, under sovereignty and self-determination laws, tribes established Federal Indian Policy with the U.S. government.  Given this historical context, it is understandable that sovereignty and self-determination are paramount concerns in evaluations in Indigenous contexts. Tribal sovereignty and self-determination are not merely federal- level legal distinctions, but also have implications in terms of documenting, monitoring, improving, and supporting nation-building efforts carried out by Tribal governments and Tribal programs (Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, 2008; Jorgensen, 2007). Tribal identity, culture, health, education, and long-term socioeconomic success depend on nation-building efforts in which evaluation can be a key factor. Truly effective evaluation requires respect for and ability to navigate within this multijurisdictional (federal, state, local, and Tribal) environment.  In this chapter, we discuss what constitutes culturally responsive evalua- tion in the Indigenous context, focusing on theory, research, and policy that inform construction of culturally responsive Indigenous evaluation frame- works, political/legal considerations in Indigenous evaluation, and cultural/ traditional concerns. We also describe the current state of culturally respon- sive evaluation in the Indigenous context, explain barriers to culturally re- sponsive evaluation, and explore how those barriers are being addressed. We then use a case example to illustrate how principles of culturally responsive evaluation can be employed in a real-world Indigenous context in order to “see the world through the eyes of our ancestors and translate the best knowl- edge of the world into acceptable modern scientifi terminology” (Deloria & Wildcat, 2001, p. 28). In conclusion, we discuss progress toward culturally responsive evaluation in Indigenous contexts and steps for future growth.   CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE EVALUATION IN THE INDIGENOUS CONTEXT    Overview   Evaluators and researchers must understand that Indigenous people, programs, and communities exist within various geographic contexts: rural,    338  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    urban, and Tribal reservation lands. Tribal reservations are part of the 565 federally recognized tribes acknowledged by the U.S. government. Each of these Tribal governments has their own set of elected officials, their own Tribal governance operational structure, and their own laws, policies, and procedures. Beyond Tribal governments, the focus of the case example in this chapter, there are also urban Indian communities. Urban Indian com- munities are found in large cities across the United States (e.g., New York, NY; San Francisco Bay Area, CA; Minneapolis, MN, Chicago, IL). Urban Indian communities normally have a community center, health center, and other urban Indian programming offices where services and resources are available to Indigenous people living off the reservation. Off-reservation In- dians also reside in rural and suburban areas; generally, these people either go to Tribal reservations or urban Indian centers to receive services and programming. All these communities have varying legal jurisdictions, im- plement policy and programs differently, and have unique cultural norms set by the community members living in the geographic space.    Theory, Research, and Policy Informing Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation    Because the academic base of Indigenous evaluation theory is not as ro- bust or long-standing as work in other fields, we look to Indigenous guide- lines from the research, education, and policy fields to anchor our evalua- tion work. Our chapter, like many of our Indigenous evaluation colleagues’ presentations and published works, humbly offers our perspectives to fur- ther contribute to this knowledge base.  Tribal Critical Theory is a theoretical framework and method used to examine Indigenous people throughout the world for personal and Trib- al empowerment and liberation (Brayboy, 2005; Pulitano, 2003). Unlike Critical Race Theory (CRT), which asserts that racism is endemic to so- ciety, TCT holds that colonization2 is endemic to society (Brayboy, 2005). Brayboy’s (2005) summary of TCT explains that this theory recognizes that Indigenous peoples strive toward Tribal sovereignty, Tribal autonomy, self- determination, and self-identification; this can conflict with governmental policies that are tied to the problematic goal of assimilation. TCT empha- sizes the importance of Tribal beliefs, philosophies, and customs for under- standing they lived reality of Indigenous people as well as the differences among individuals and groups. It also recognizes the importance of story as a legitimate data source and building block of theory, and insists that the interconnected nature of theory and practice demands that researchers work toward social change.    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  339 �    Evaluation designs influenced by TCT have the potential to employ Indigenous strategies that are authentic and alternative ways of knowing ( Jacobs, 2008; Mertens & Cram, 2013; Mertens & Wilson, 2012) as well as contextually responsive, culturally relevant, and educationally empowering now and for the next seven generations3 (Bergstrom, Cleary, & Peacock, 2003; LaFrance & Nichols, 2009).  Indigenous Evaluation Frameworks (IEF) situates an evaluation in con- text and relationship to the place, setting, and community in which the evaluation is carried out (LaFrance et al., 2012). In their work, LaFrance and Nichols (2010) identify four key values that must be included in creat- ing IEF: being a people of a place, recognizing gifts, honoring family and community, and respecting sovereignty. IEF is a holistic framework that is conceptualized, designed, and carried out in a nonlinear way, with relation- ships and sub relationships concurrently informing one another and the evaluation as a whole. As Indigenous evaluators and authors, we often say, “We work with you, not on you” when serving an Indigenous community or client with an evaluation study. An analogy used by elders to describe this process is to envision sitting in a circle around the lodge or campfire and talking equally about perspectives, strategies, decisions, and usefulness of information for now and the next seven future generations. This philosophy differs from many Western theories and methods where evaluation and research is deemed an objective, disconnected, “study” of a program, project, community, or people.  The principles of TCT and IEF align with a larger, national, “Tribally driven” Indian research agenda (National Congress of American Indians Policy Research Center [NCAI PRC], 2013) that incorporates the following Indigenous guidelines (Strang & von Glatz, 2001):   • embracing the spirit of Indigenous sovereignty and self-determina-  tion within [an evaluation] context; • providing educational research [and evaluation] for Tribal student,  family, and community empowerment; • legitimizing and liberating the Indigenous voice and perspective  while deconstructing majority educational paradigms; and • purposefully instructing and disseminating scholarly discourse  within Native and non-Native publications, research and policy forums, public debates, educational or academic [and evaluation] communities and contexts.   As Indigenous evaluators, we consider these principles of Tribal control  of a research agenda and evaluation central to our professional and aca- demic evaluation work.    340  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    The Political/Legal Context of Indigenous Evaluation   Sovereignty	and	self‐determination.	The late Daniel K. Inouye, U.S. Senator from Hawaii, testified many  times that, “the sovereign status of Indian Nations predates the formation of the United States” (Wilkinson, 2004, p. xi). As a lifetime advocate for the political and legal rights of Indigenous people in the United States (Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, and Native Americans), Senator Inouye under- stood the fundamental right of Tribal nations and Indian people to self- governance. Sovereignty (broadly), under federal law, recognizes that In- dian nations are sovereign governments separate from the federal and state government, with their own inherent and unique rights to govern (Cohen, 1942; Pevar, 2012; U.S. Department of the Interior [DOI], 2013a; Wilkins & Lomawaima, 2001). Internationally, these distinct and legal protections ex- tend to Indigenous people to safeguard their economic, social, cultural, linguistic, and political freedoms through the United Nations Declaration of Rights for Indigenous People (UN, 2008), including tribes or Indigenous governments in the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.  Researchers and evaluators must understand that when they conduct research within Tribal contexts, they are no longer under the jurisdiction of the state or federal government but rather that of the Tribal govern- ment. Thus, recognizing the tenets of Tribal sovereignty, self-governance, and self-determination, how these tenets intersect with state and federal laws and programs and their practical and logistical implications is critical to conducting culturally responsive, competent, and practical evaluations in Indian Country.   Multijurisdictional	approaches	 to	 Indigenous	 evaluation.	 Tribal governments follow their unique Tribal constitutions and are re- sponsible for upholding Tribal law as well as protecting Tribal members’ safety, rights, and well-being from non-Indian governments, organizations, and people. However, there is uneven capacity for evaluation across the 565 Tribal governments in the United States (DOI, 2013b). Tribal Institu- tional Review Boards (IRBs) and other human subject protocols are not consistent across Tribal governments or other Tribal organizations, and the comprehensiveness and formality of these ordinances, policies, and proce- dures vary widely. For example, fewer than 10% (Bowman, 2006a) of 565 recognized Tribal governments (Norris, Vines, & Hoeffel, 2012) have IRBs. Furthermore, of the 35 Tribal colleges operating in the United States, only 25% of them have their own IRB (Bowman, 2006a). Fewer than 1% of the Tribal governments have Tribal policies or Tribal IRBs for research, evalua- tion, and policy studies (Bowman, 2006a), and roughly 1% had ordinances, policies, and procedures formally developed for their Tribal IRB to work    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  341 �    in conjunction with non-Tribal partners (DOI, 2013b). This is problematic because when Tribal governments or Indigenous organizations (Tribal col- leges, Tribal nonprofits, etc.) do not establish their own IRBs and other evaluation policies, they are more susceptible to designs, data, and pro- grams that are not valid or effective for Indian populations in the long term (Bowman, 2006a; Deloria, 2002; NCAI PRC, 2013). The current lack of capacity and infrastructure to support culturally responsive evaluation that is led or overseen by Indigenous organizations or Tribal governments contributes to confusion and misunderstanding in the political/legal con- text of evaluation.  This confusion around the political/legal context is compounded by the current disconnect and lack of clarity between Indian and non-Indian people in terms of how policies are carried out through programming, doc- umenting best practices, conducting appropriate evaluations, and human subject protection in Indigenous contexts at the institutional and systemic level. Often, federal and state governments do not recognize or under- stand the collective responsibilities and power of Tribal government IRBs (National Institute of Justice, 2013). In terms of education, the jurisdiction and authority for the education of Indian students who do not reside on a reservation has not been clearly established by case law (Native American Rights Fund, 2000), leaving it unclear as to who is responsible for ethical and culturally appropriate research on and off the reservation—external funding agencies or tribes? This lack of clarity leaves legal gaps and little leverage for Tribal governments or Indigenous organizations to negotiate or protect their human subjects and Tribal intellectual property, or keep cultural protection safeguards in place when working on programs funded by non-Indian governments, universities, and other nonprofit or for profit organizations.  We can look to work done in the justice and health fields for practical guidance in this regard when creating evaluations in Indigenous legal/po- litical contexts. Multijurisdictionality is a legal term applied most often in justice contexts (Bureau of Justice Assistance, 2012). The federal govern- ment, usually through the justice and health departments, uses a multi- jurisdictional approach with state, municipal, and Tribal governments. This multijurisdictional approach links all forms of government into an inter- connected system that helps agencies form policy task forces and working groups; develop information and resource sharing practices; form political alliances, create memos of understanding and legal ordinances or struc- tures; and carry out research and evaluation studies to properly document evidence-based programs and practices carried out in municipal, state, fed- eral, and Tribal contexts.  The evaluation community could benefit from a multijurisdictional framework when working in Indian Country, and much work has been    342  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    done to identify and establish the foundations of a multijurisdictional ap- proach to evaluation in the Indigenous context (Bowman, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011; Bowman & Dodge Francis, 2014; Bow- man & Tyndall, 2014). From multijurisdictional work in other fields, we have determined that good evaluation design and implementation in the Indigenous context   • considers Tribal, state, federal, and international laws and policies for  human subject protection, research or evaluation, intellectual and cultural property rights, data sharing agreements, and/or ownership, publication, and dissemination agreements that already exist;  • identifies connections and differences between Tribal grantee and non-Tribal funding agency policies and procedures;  • acknowledges current infrastructure and builds on commonalities and strengths in policies, reporting formats, and expectations;  • identifies and articulates policy and procedure gaps or differences in order to bridge gaps to achieve consensus;  • provides visual examples of forms, instruments, or other databases to demonstrate the grantee’s potential evaluation methodology;  • uses or modifies existing Tribal instruments, databases, or processes; • considers from the Tribal perspective how evaluation may enhance  the development of current or new capacities, policies, or protocols for sustaining programming after the grant has ended;  • shares successes and best practices with other Tribal governments and Indigenous organizations, with the knowledge, consent, and participation of Tribal constituents;  • obtains permission to share, present on, or publish information out- side of the Indigenous context in order to protect human subjects, cultural protections, and intellectual property rights.   By incorporating these best practices, the formal component of Indig-  enous evaluation recognizes existing Tribal capacity, considers local eval- uation needs, and addresses what the funder requires. Both the funder’s requirements and the needs of the governing local agency (Tribal govern- ment, Tribal nonprofit board, Tribal school board, etc.) are considered and included in the evaluation design.    The Cultural/Traditional Context of Indigenous Evaluation    In this section, we explore the cultural/traditional context of indigenous evaluation. The cultural/traditional context takes into account the com- munity’s shared collection of learned and socially transmitted behaviors,    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  343 �    beliefs, and institutions that act as a template to shape behavior and con- sciousness from generation to generation.   Evaluation	and	evaluators	in	the	cultural/traditional	context.	 Evaluation completes the circle of research, development, and practice. However, an evaluator must possess the skills, knowledge, and competen- cies to design and carry out a culturally responsive evaluation that uniquely addresses an Indigenous context and project. An evaluator must be pre- pared to include multicultural validity (Kirkhart, 2005) because it is cen- tral to creating an evaluation design that produces valid, reliable, culturally responsive, and contextually appropriate findings. Cultural incompetency or lack of a multicultural and contextual lens in evaluation leads to non- responsive evaluation designs and methods that can generate inaccurate, inappropriate, or even harmful findings.  Tribal governments and Indigenous organizations must often rely upon outsiders and/or a non-Indian person, public agency, or other organization to conduct evaluation work. Currently, there are few Indigenous evaluation scholars trained to participate in evaluation-related activities. Of course, their near absence in the community of evaluation scholars is due in part to their near absence on the faculties of our colleges and universities (Turner, 2002) and in graduate programs that serve as a pipeline for evaluation prac- titioners and/or scholars. Native Americans are by far the least represented of all racial/ethnic groups in U.S. graduate programs (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012), which helps explain why we lack a sufficient pool of technically and culturally responsive evaluators4 for and from Indian Country.  Therefore, in these situations, the evaluator for an Indigenous project in an Indigenous context becomes responsible not only for designing the evaluation, but for being a trusted teacher who can help facilitate capacity building with the community being evaluated and the project members carrying out the grant or program being evaluated. A culturally responsive evaluator has the knowledge, skills, and abilities for evaluation but also is in- tentional and inclusive when selecting and implementing evaluation design and methods based on the cultural and contextual needs of the project, context, participants, and stakeholders.   Defining	 the	cultural/traditional	context.	Cajete (1994) reminds Indigenous people to Look to the Mountain for  guidance, where the mountain represents traditional Indigenous knowledge. Thisknowledgeislocatedwithinthecultural/traditionalcontext,whichis equally as important as the political/legal (or formal Tribal government) context. This context includes beliefs, behaviors, and institutions, and is gov- erned by core values and protocols carried out by the community’s tradition- al leaders, elders, and students. It has elements that predate the infl       344  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    of European cultures and the assimilation policies administered by colonial and modern America. Despite eff to colonize Indigenous peoples, their epistemologies in one form or another continue to exist today.  The cultural/traditional context includes formal and informal but tradi- tional teachings and leadership most often held by elders, medicine men or women, linguists, and other knowledge keepers of Tribal history and culture. These are not elected offi rather, they are leaders dictated by cultural protocols, oral histories, and familial lines. The cultural/traditional context for an Indigenous evaluation design also includes members living on or off the reservation who are not traditional or cultural leaders or elected offi of the Tribal government. Most often these are the members of the Tribal population who coexist daily with others who are engaged in regular com- munity (sociocultural) activities, are the participants in or recipients of Tribal programming and resources, and are responsible for holding accountable the elected and employed members of the Tribal government.  The Indigenous epistemic culture distinguishes between various settings of knowledge production and emphasizes their contextual aspects (Knorr Cetina, 1999); this differs from the Western epistemic culture. The Indig- enous protocols around how knowledge is gained, used, shared, protected, and respected must be acknowledged and upheld above all other epistemic cultural protocols. Indigenous epistemic culture is not monolithic; each In- digenous community has a unique way of learning, thinking, and doing; in- fluenced by language, culture, and beliefs, that must be taken into account.  For Indigenous communities, simply measuring outcomes and evaluat- ing what needs improvement is not considered a comprehensive design. Inclusion of process data, documentation of what is working, and includ- ing measurements for sustainability after the grant monies are gone or the evaluation study has concluded is considered a balanced approach to evalu- ation in Indigenous contexts. Therefore, the process of carrying out an evaluation is just as important—if not more so—than the final evaluation products (reports, instruments, presentations, publications, etc.); in other words, the journey is as important as the destination. Both the process and the products of an evaluation study must be sustainable and useful to the Tribal government and community it serves long after the evaluation or research project has been completed.   Components	of	the	cultural/traditional	context.	 Components of the cultural/traditional context include geographic loca- tion; cultural and language protocols; heritage, lineage, and familial relation- ships; access rights to knowledge and to disseminate that knowledge; and review and endorsement from community cultural/traditional practitioners. All these components inform what cultural information can or cannot be collected and how, in order to produce a version of the community cultural/    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  345 �    traditional knowledge that is valid and appropriate for a broader audience outside of the local Indigenous community. The discussion that follows is not comprehensive, but provides an overview of several of the cultural consider- ations that must be addressed in the cultural/traditional context.   Access	rights	to	knowledge.	 In addition to working with elected Tribal officials or Tribal employees, it is important to also seek out those community leaders, elders, and tradition- al teachers who uphold informal but powerful cultural protocols. Culturally responsive evaluation in the Indigenous context goes beyond the legal and academic structures of an evaluation by including cultural, linguistic, and other community safeguards that protect Indigenous communities knowl- edge and data. Providing a traditional gift (which may be tobacco, venison, cloth, or something else, depending on the cultural practices of the Tribal community) as permission or a thank you for considering the evaluation design and participating in the study is an example of a community safe- guard. Discussing in advance the proposed study and methods and asking what the community would like in return for participating in and support- ing the study are examples of respecting the safety of the community.  In terms of data collection, evaluators must be aware that knowledge is shared in negotiated spaces; for example, information gleaned in a sacred space like a sweat lodge or teaching circle may not be available to or shared with outside investigators and the wider world in the way that information from more public ceremonies or discussions might be. It is worth noting that the protection of Indigenous knowledge has taken on even more sig- nificance as the number of industries or commercialized businesses seek- ing to use biodiversity and the Indigenous knowledge related to it have grown. Given the historical treatment of Indigenous people, incorporating this component into Indigenous evaluation design is critical to building trust with communities who have been and continue to be disempowered, disenfranchised, and decimated by non-Indian policies, organizations, and governments.   Oral	versus	written	knowledge	transmission.	 Traditionally, for Indigenous people, knowledge development, collec- tion, and transfer are primarily oral processes. Western or European pro- cesses for data collection and evaluation privileges statistics and the written word as the principal ways of documenting data, transferring knowledge, or citing evidence in research or evaluation studies. Not only is this a cultural and methodological disconnect, but it also creates capacity, infrastructure, and resource issues for improving the policy process or program impact through evaluation and raises methodological questions. For instance, are oral history methods better suited for assessment and evaluation versus an    346  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    online survey? How do linguistic translations from the Native language dif- fer among participants and how does this interpretation impact the evalua- tion data being collected?  Culturally responsive evaluation in this context does not privilege the written word but understands that oral traditions in Indigenous contexts are often more sacred, respected, and protected than the written protocols. Safeguards can be orally transmitted (Indigenous Peoples Council on Bio- colonialism, 2004; Mihesuah & Wilson, 2004; Smith, 2012) but can also be created in writing with shared memorandums of understanding, formally approved IRB or Tribal government protocols, and other human subject protection processes agreed upon by the Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants and organizations. Samples of such protocols and formal agreements can be found by contacting Tribal government agencies and Indigenous scholars, or through checking Indigenous websites from Tribal colleges, Tribal nonprofits, and other Tribal for-profit organizations that conduct regular research in Indian Country.   Social	and	political	status.	 Evaluators must remember that context matters and that safeguards vary because Tribal communities, organizations, and governments are not monolithic. The cultural and linguistic practices of each Tribal community (and within families or clans of a Tribal community) dictate political status, social responsibilities through family and clans, and leadership based on matrilineal or patrilineal grounds. Evaluators must understand and address the fact that their own personal characteristics (male or female, insider or outsider, traditional or nontraditional, Native or non-Native, elder or adult, etc.) can all affect the safeguards needed by the Tribal community in a research context as well as the level of access a researcher has within the Indigenous context.  To summarize, cultural context must inform the evaluation design, pro- cesses, and methods. Without these knowledge, skills, and competencies, an evaluator will potentially create evaluation studies, use approaches, and gen- erate fi that are inconsistent, incongruent, and/or are invalid with the Indian people and community that the program is supposed to serve.   Benefits	of	incorporating	the	cultural/traditional	context.	 The incorporation of the cultural/traditional context in the evaluation process is essential to Tribal communities, due to the shared belief or truth that by maintaining, respecting, and continually incorporating the beliefs, protocols, and practices of our traditional Tribal ways we can, “see the world through the eyes of our ancestors and translate the best knowledge of the world into acceptable modern scientific terminology” (Deloria & Wildcat, 2001, p. 28).    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  347 �    This cultural knowledge may inform evaluators of goals, measurable out- comes, and impact indicators that otherwise would not have been foreseen. Using resources available to a culturally responsive evaluator from the cul- tural/traditional context (in conjunction with the political/legal context and funder requirements) helps to build a comprehensive evaluation de- sign, one that truly reveals and captures the underlying cultural knowledge, challenges, and experiences that influence the lives of Indigenous peoples living in the local and broad community from the Tribal participants who are part of the evaluation.  Recognizing and using elements from a cultural/traditional context is a process for decolonizing (Wilson & Yellowbird, 2005) an evaluation in an authentic attempt to re-write and re-right (Smith, 2012) history and cre- ate capacity for better decision-making in the future to benefit Indigenous communities and participants. Responsive evaluation approaches will gen- erate useful program information, authentically engage all participants, and will help to shape future policy and practice that will positively affect the next seven generations.   CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE EVALUATION:  A CASE EXAMPLE    In this section of the chapter, we use a case example from our work to illus- trate how the culturally responsive Indigenous evaluation strategies, frame- works, and competencies discussed earlier in the chapter can be applied in real-world Indigenous contexts.    Background   In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released  a funding opportunity, entitled Health Promotion and Diabetes Prevention Proj- ects for AI/AN Communities: Adaptations of Practical Community Environmental Indicators (CDC, 2005), NDWP/DDT/NCCDPHP. The funding opportunity was to establish 3-year cooperative agreements within Tribal communities. The program purpose of the CDC grant was to “strengthen local capacity of AI/AN communities in implementing limited, practical community en- vironmental interventions for health promotion and diabetes prevention” (CDC, 2005, p. 29761). It should be noted that this grant did not constitute a research methodology but reflected a public health perspective (CDC, 2008). The Indigenous community in which our work was conducted was one of eight CDC grantees.    348  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    Given the unique political/legal and cultural/traditional distinctions of Indigenous people and communities, our evaluations most often use a re- sponsive Indigenous case study design. Case studies address why decisions or strategies were used, how they were implemented, and describes what type of results there were (Schramm, 1971). Research or evaluation in Western contexts is usually experiential, prioritizing the impressions of the observer, standardized measures, and statistical aggregation (Stake, 1986). In contrast, in this instance, the Indigenous project evaluation model incorporated dis- tinct Tribal voices from the breadth of community and the health promotion and prevention project. The evaluation focused on assets, barriers, and the incorporation of traditional teachings into programming, and employed a mixed and multimethod evaluation to the design. Our study design used data collection instruments to collect and confi data throughout the project. Evaluation fi   helped shape data-driven discussions, were used to modi- fy program implementation eff and also annually revealed best practices associated with the most eff program activities. This design allowed continuous program evaluation and built upon the human and infrastruc- ture capacities for future evaluations. A constant and comparative process for analysis was used throughout the evaluation, and continual community member-checking for formative and summative evaluation fi was em- ployed throughout the evaluation process.    Evaluation Participants    The Indigenous community is a federally recognized Indian tribe oc- cupying a reservation that was established by treaty agreements between the Tribal government and U.S. federal government. The Tribal govern- ment operates pursuant to a constitution promulgated under the Indian Reorganization Act, 1934. The tribe’s land base exists within the Midwest. The reservation boundaries encompass two townships where approximate- ly 21,000 acres are either held in trust or owned by the tribe. The villages closest to the reservation have a population no greater than 600 residents. Moderate-to-large urban Indian communities that have impact on social and economic conditions of the tribe are located 60–170 miles away. Like many tribes, this Indigenous community was displaced from the ancestral territory, which they inhabited for millennia, by colonial forces. Losing Tribal lands and ways of life that depended on them resulted in a culture shift away from a long-established economy and system of governance that was elaborate and complex.  Fewer than 3,000 people live within the reservation boundaries. Demo- graphics from the 2010 Census noted an unemployment rate of 14.6% on the tribe’s reservation. The median household income level in 2009 was    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  349 �    $36,908. For female full-time year-round workers, the median earning level was $23,917; for male full-time year-round workers, the median earning level was $28,365. The average per capita income was $15,272. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, 15.1% of Tribal families living on the reservation lived in poverty in 2009; all of these families had children under age 18.    Case Study Evaluation Design    The four project goals of the CDC grant for this particular grantee were to assist the community in identifying, implementing, and evaluating envi- ronmental health interventions for youth; assist youth in establishing life- long healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors; involve parents in all aspects of the proposed program; and impact and positively influence the community for establishing lifelong healthy eating and physical activity behaviors through programs, activities, and environmental changes (poli- cies). In order to evaluate this project, we used the following culturally re- sponsive Indigenous evaluation methods.   Community	 collaborations.	 Self-determination respects, recognizes, and values the inherent worth of Indian culture; is responsive to the community’s needs as voiced by all members of society; builds programs around Indian assets and resources; and employs Indians in every part of the process including, program, poli- cy, implementation, and evaluation. Based upon this foundation, we moved forward with co-planning our evaluation with the key assumption that ev- eryone shares responsibility for achieving positive community wellness. Our evaluation process honored and incorporated the value of self-determina- tion in several ways.  Before the evaluation research began, evaluators and participants worked together to create a culturally relevant evaluation plan in a dialogue and brainstorming process that honored the “seven-generations” teachings of including elders’, community members’, and youth perspectives as we consider how current actions and behaviors impact future generations. Rather than imposing outside data collection methods upon the commu- nity, we asked community members to help identify existing data sources (e.g., agendas, media releases, community center sign-in sheets, etc.) to use in our evaluation as a community collaboration and means to consensus- based decision making. Monthly work and advisory meetings with project participants continually revisited how program implementation was meet- ing or not meeting the self-identified needs of the community resulting in a flexible evaluation design that continued to address real-life issues through realistic and locally viable solutions.    350  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    The evaluator and project stakeholders worked together to jointly com- municate successes and involve local schools, community organizations, and other Tribal governmental offices and programs. Communicating successful outcomes with Tribal and community partners leveraged more growth, secured shared resources, and strengthened sustainable program efforts for continuing positive changes and programming long after the grant ended. For example, grant work done to upgrade ballfields inspired local government spending on upgraded fencing around the fields as well as new uniforms for ballplayers. When new playground equipment was in- stalled at the at pow wow grounds, the Tribal Roads and Planning Depart- ment contributed extra funds for wood chips for the playground area.   Cultural		relevance.	 Ensuring that evaluations are culturally relevant allows communities to heal, strengthen, and preserve Indigenous societies now and for the next seven generations. Our evaluation process honored the unique culture and traditions of this community in many ways. We began the evaluation pro- cess by approaching elders and community leaders with appropriate gifts (in this case, tobacco and traditional foods like venison and berries) as we asked their permission to begin and for their help in this project.  In particular, we ensured that our evaluation used culturally appropriate data collection methods and instruments. As discussed above, we worked with the program participants to identify existing data sources that meet evaluation needs rather than imposing our own measurement methodol- ogy. Where we did identify data collection gaps, we worked together with community members to find new, culturally relevant ways to collect data. For example, students in the community who participated in the collabora- tive process identified themselves as “data warriors” (a culturally resonant term) and brainstormed ways to gather needed data, including collecting local restaurant menus and taking pictures of vending machines used in the community to document their contents. “Pow wow pedometers” measured the number of steps taken and calories burned by fancy dancers versus tra- ditional dancers at ceremonies. These data collection methods and instru- ments quantified healthy behavioral changes and involved participants in a way that honored the principal of “working with” rather than “working on.” These data collection methods were unique to the grantee but also became an opportunity to expand Indigenous knowledge and understanding from the funders’ perspective.  As the grant program continued, evaluators worked with participants to identify ways that program elements could be culturally relevant and meet program goals. New policies were created around traditional food use and access. Participants worked to acquire ancestral food knowledge and incorporate traditional healthy food into daily menus as well as special    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  351 �    social-cultural events like pow wows, field trips, and ceremonies. Student data collectors, their families, and actively engaged project participants influenced policy around healthy choices in community center vending machines and food provided at community center events. The goal of all program elements was to incorporate healthy lifestyle choices in ways that were culturally relevant and sustainable after the CDC program concluded.   Dissemination.	 Sharing knowledge and respect for Indigenous knowledge rights is an- other key component of culturally responsive evaluation. At each stage of the project implementation and evaluation process, evaluators worked to communicate program status to participants and to listen and respond to participants’ ideas and concerns. Monthly work and advisory meetings en- sured that information was shared for decision making, assessing impacts, and for making project or program modifications in an ongoing process. Our evaluation team worked to share project data with the wider commu- nity in multiple formats. We were sure to encompass the oral dimension of Indigenous knowledge sharing in meetings, presentations, traditional talking circles, and participation in community events. Project staff pre- pared reports for the local Tribal government, school district boards of education, in the Tribal newspaper, on the Tribal website, and the national funding agency on a quarterly to semiannual basis. One program element was monthly demonstrations showing how to make Indigenous and tra- ditional food in healthier ways; another was a cookbook that highlighted new knowledge about healthy traditional foods. Visual formats, such GIS mapping related to the project, as well as project photographs, helped tell the story of this project to the community. We also used more traditional Western practices, such as sharing information through non-Tribal newslet- ters, press releases, and written reports to communicate with the project participants and the wider community. Open communication within the Tribal community helped shape new choices in Tribal programming, Tribal recreation center menus, and through the local school’s health curriculum and cafeteria menus.  With careful and respectful consideration of the appropriate use and sharing of knowledge in this context, we worked with participants to share our findings with the wider public. Co-authored reports and presentations by Tribal and non-Tribal organizations and staff members increased trust, built relationships, built capacities for technical reports and presentations, and gave credibility to and shared responsibility for the evaluation study findings. The data was used in further grants, collaborative programming, and leveraging additional resources to carry out health initiatives extend- ing to Tribal and non-Tribal schools, restaurants, parks, and other commu- nal spaces or contexts.    352  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    This example of a culturally responsive evaluation demonstrates how eval- uators can empower Indigenous communities and individuals through evalu- ation by honoring traditional knowledge, making evaluation useful to com- munity needs, and by respecting Indigenous ownership of evaluation data.   DISCUSSION  “Indiginizing” Evaluation   As illustrated by the case study above, culturally responsive evaluation  can help build capacity throughout the evaluation process if empowerment (Fetterman, Kaftarian, & Wandersman, 1996), Indigenous, (Bowman, 2006a; Denzin, Lincoln, & Smith, 2008; Kovach, 2010; LaFrance & Nichols, 2009; LaFrance et al., 2012; Mertens & Cram, 2013; Smith, 2012), and utili- zation focused (Patton, 2012) approaches are used.  Table 16.1 demonstrates how we transform the seven steps of colonial- ism as defined by Frideres and Gadacz (2000) to create a more culturally responsive case design and process for conducting Indigenous evaluations.    Progress Toward Culturally Responsive Evaluation  in the Indigenous Context    Currently, few Tribal governments or Indigenous organizations use evaluation data as an effective tool for shaping Tribal or multijurisdictional public policy, making budgetary decisions, and/or to drive programmatic decision making. In any work toward this goal, the tenets of trust, data own- ership, and sovereign rights of Tribal people on or off the reservation need to be part of a concerted dialogue by all parties (Tsosie, 2007). Building this capacity will require a significant investment in time and money for restructuring, building infrastructures (technology, data collection systems, creating ordinances, policies, etc.), providing staff development, and sup- porting organizational development to carry out new ordinances, policies, and procedures across Tribal government or Indigenous organizations and systems. The scope of training, technical assistance, and interfacing of In- dian and non-Indian governments, systems, and programs needed to de- velop common evaluation policy, culturally responsive evaluation designs, and data collection or sharing systems is staggering. But without evaluation capacity building within, across, and outside of Indian Country, the pattern of long-term educational, economic, health, and other disparities that In- dian people have endured will likely continue.    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  353 �    TABLE 16.1    Indigenizing Evaluation  Seven Steps of Colonialism (Frideres & Gadacz, 2000)  Seven Steps to Decolonialize and Indigenize (Bowman, 2007a)   1.

Indigenous intellectual knowledge, approval of evaluation, and ownership of data by Tribal community is controlled by Indigenous community and is formalized through memos of understanding with researcher and research organization  5. Evaluation data provides information to inform and improve local services being provided by Tribal and non- Tribal governments for Indigenous community members  6. Critical examination by an external traditional knowledge council and participants to prohibit racism, end colonist practices in evaluation, and promote the value and use of Indigenous knowledge and processes  7. Empower Indigenous communities and individuals through evaluation by honoring traditional knowledge, making evaluation useful to community needs, and through Indigenous control/ownership of evaluation data    Despite challenges, we see hopeful progress toward more culturally re- sponsive evaluation practices. Tribes, along with many professional and po- litical support organizations like the National Congress of American Indi- ans (NCAI), Native American Rights Fund (NARF), and Tribal Education Departments National Assembly (TEDNA), have politically engaged state and federal government systems and non-Indian organizations to help ad- dress capacity issues. For instance, NCAI, NARF, and TEDNA have worked with non-Indian governments and organizations to help develop Tribal policy, facilitated Tribal consultation sessions with non-Tribal governments, and have convened training and technical assistance sessions. An increas- ing number of tribes are moving proactively to create their own IRBs under the Department of Health and Human Services, Code of Federal Regula- tions, Title 45 Public Welfare, Part 46 Protection of Human Subjects, which was first issued in 1974 (Department of Health and Human Services, 2009). These federal, tribal, and other international (UN, 2008) ordinances, policies, and guidelines in promoting and designing culturally responsive    354  N. R. BOWMAN, C. D. FRANCIS, and M. TYNDALL�    evaluation approaches can be used to move us toward addressing current low capacity and resource issues as well as building a stronger empirical literature base for academia.  To broaden the pool of culturally responsive Indigenous evaluators, vary- ing levels of collaboration are essential to ensure current and future pro- gramming growth for the inclusion of Indigenous evaluators and to fill the publication gaps in evaluation literature and academic studies. There are long- and short-term impacts to be considered: creating a formal plan, task force, or coalition of like-minded colleagues in combination with Tribal colleges, Tribal governments, and other Tribal organizations (nonprofit or corporate) would be a good way to begin this journey.  For Tribal communities, culturally responsive evaluation models and practices have heightened the awareness of bridging cultural context is- sues of Native/non-Native, federal/self-governance, Western/Indigenous epistemology and consideration of the evaluators’ own world perspective. It is critically important that Tribal governments and Indigenous organiza- tions have the right, ability, and responsibility to adapt and use their cul- tural knowledge; the power to create ordinances, policies, and protocols for intellectual and cultural protection, preservation, and monitoring of evaluation projects; and the authority to establish, implement, and hold ac- countable the use of standardized measures for program effectiveness and services to create political and cultural norms that are reflective of their people on and off the reservation.  As Tribal communities move forward into the world of program evalua- tion, a hybrid model of Westernized institutional structures and an authentic culturally responsive system should be the goal. As in many transformations, the question that usually surfaces is “How does the angst of acculturation stay balanced and true to American Indian ideologies?” (Dodge Francis, 2009, p. 87). The impact of academia, evaluators, and community partner- ships outside of Tribal communities will play a significant role in defining, shaping, and supporting the contextual framework of evaluation method- ology, implementation, and outcomes of an evaluation approach selected within a Tribal setting. Tribal communities must not lose sight of the quest to create or attain a culturally responsive evaluation system that embraces their hegemonic ability to dictate the mission, infrastructure, or organiza- tional framework. This does not always come easily or overnight given the challenges noted earlier in the chapter.  In conclusion, this chapter synthesizes available Indigenous evaluation theories, knowledge, and frameworks in combination with evaluation re- sources provided to us from other disciplines and non-Indigenous sources. We do this with the hopeful vision of “continuing the journey.” Our work and that of others, both named and unnamed in our chapter, inspires us to be part of the work of building the theoretical and empirical basis of    Culturally Responsive Indigenous Evaluation  355 �    Indigenous evaluation. We will continue to “position” ourselves as profes- sionals working toward a deeper academic base for Indigenous evaluation with the help of our evaluation community, colleagues, and friends. In the natural time and process, we look forward to how we may eventually “repo- sition” ourselves as we continue on the journey to construct, deconstruct, practice, and learn more deeply about the Indigenous footprint for evalu- ation theory and practice. It is our prayer that together we may continue walking this good path. Anushiik.

Indigenous is used as a general term; it is also used interchangeably with Indian, Native American, American Indian, First Nation, by naming a specific tribal affiliation or languages, and/or via other Indigenous phrases as we deemed appropriate or as noted within cited source materials.  2. Colonization is when an alien people invade the territory inhabited by people of a different race and culture and establish political, social, spiritual, intellec- tual, and economic domination over that territory (Yellow Bird, 1999). Colo- nization is a political act that marginalizes Indigenous people (Adams, 1997).  3. The expression “seven generations” is a widely accepted Indigenous cultural understanding. This metaphor refers to a sustainability theory based upon ancient epistemology shared among multiple Woodland and Indigenous Nations (Benton-Banai, 1988; Bergstrom et al., 2003). The seven genera- tion model argues that leadership, communities, and individuals need to be mindful that decisions they make affect the livelihood of all future genera- tions (Dumont, 1996), including humans, animals, and plants. (LaDuke & Alexander, 2004). The model also advocates for leadership to take actions that sustain best practices in governance (Williams & Works, 2007) in order to ensure wellness for all in creation.  4. We deliberately chose the term “culturally responsive evaluator” versus “cultur- ally competent evaluator.” An evaluator may be culturally competent but may not always choose to be responsive when conducting Indigenous evaluations.    356  N.
