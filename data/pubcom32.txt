I began my career using restricted data from the U.S. Census and have long used these types of data, both in the U.S. and in Great Britain for research and evaluation purposes.   I have served as a Direction of the Kentucky Center for Business and Economic Research (CBER) and am currently the Executive Director of the Kentucky Research Data Center (KRDC, a part of the FSRDC system).  My experiences with CBER provide insights into working with state and local policy makers.  While my research record and service with KRDC provide insights on working with restricted data.  1. What are the main challenges faced by national, state/provincial, or local governments that are trying to build a basis for evidence-based policy? Briefly describe the bottlenecks and pain-points they face in the evidence-based decision-making process.  As former director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Kentucky, I have worked with state and local governments to address important policy questions.  While sometimes good public use data are available.  For example, Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is used to support public/private partnerships.  Designated TIF zones are often smaller than census tracts.  Information on worker earnings and firms are often unavailable for public use at this small level of geography.   A number of data sources, including the Longitudinal Business Database do contain these details, but are difficult to obtain access to.  While KY Stats has worked to provide some data for the state of Kentucky, and I applaud those efforts, evaluation of TIF and other similar policies would be facilitated by national level data, increasing sample sizes and decreasing local idiosyncrasies.  Access to these type data would enhance the ability of researchers working with policy makers.  Another major and related issue is the cooperation across different government agencies regarding access to their data.  As current director of the Kentucky Research Data Center, I note that while many agencies allow their data to be used within the FSRDC system, significant differences in access requirements, approaches and costs exist.  For example, while Census allows researchers within the RDC’s access to the data free of additional charge (beyond any charge collected by the RDC’s).  However, some agencies, such as NCHS charge an additional fee, which is often quite steep.  In my view, federal statistical agencies should be providing these data to users without charge.  Tax money has been used to collect the data, analysis of the data is crucial to its benefit to society.   This limits the benefit of a public good.  In contrast, Census requires that any project using these data benefit Census.  The Census benefits are limited to findings that support improvement in Census products.  However, a clear benefit to society is the research itself.  This limitation derives from Title 13, and needs to be addressed.

Ideally, in the formation of an NSDS, data from myriad agencies would be available with common linking technology.   The Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC or RDC) system provides a secure and safe research environment where such linking can occur, and has important disclosure safeguards in place     • Obtaining access to micro level data, especially at sub national and sub state levels is difficult. • Linkages across different data sources are difficult to obtain. • Inter and even intra agency cooperation varies dramatically.  2. What are examples of high-impact data uses for evidence-based policy making that successfully effected change, reduced costs, or improved the welfare of citizens?  As CBER Director I have used public use Census data to examine commuting patterns in the Cincinatti Metropolitan area which informed public debate about the Brent Spence Bridge.  I’ve also studied TIF zones in the Louisville area and exporting firms from Kentucky.  I have also used restricted data to evaluate an new job training program in Louisville.  All of these projects have influenced both the public debate about policy and in some cases the policy itself.  As a research, my work has examined how non-response in the CPS impacts the measurement of poverty and income volatility.  These projects have both impacted how census and other agencies contend with survey non-response and how poverty is measured nationally.  3. Which frameworks, policies, practices, or methods show promise in overcoming challenges experienced by governments in their evidence building?  Positives: The FSRDC system provides a framework, already developed, where restricted data can be accessed.   It is my opinion that the NSDS should work carefully with the FSRDC system to expand and improve access both to researchers – who are often key in providing the kind of evaluations necessary – but with state and local governments and other groups who may also benefit from access.  In Kentucky, KYSTATs has begun to link state records in education as well as employment and public program usage.   However, this is limited, and additional data could be brought to bear.  It is important that this not be a state by state type structure nor should the cost burden fall on states.  An RDC could provide a framework to link state data as well.  • The FSRDC System provides a framework already in place • Engagement with state and local data collection will improve this  Significant Concerns: While I believe the FSRDC system provides an initial framework, it is important to recognize that an NSDS and a national system of access through FSRDC’s have the danger of becoming an unfunded mandate.  While FSRDC’s are initially funded by the NSF, operational funding is provided by host institutions and consortium members.   The operational funding includes paying Census for both     Gatton College of  Business and Economics Department of Economics   Christopher R.

The KRDC budget is approximately $200,000 per year, much of which constitutes payments to Census.  In order to support this, the University of Kentucky, the Ohio State University and Indiana University contribute.  We also charge fees to users outside these three members of the consortium.   Neither I, nor the University of Kentucky, receive any compensation for the time I spend as an Executive Director.  This is another cost shifted to the RDC’s.    Because the FSRDC system is funded through these types of arrangements, building a system of access on FSRDC system poses substantial problems.  First, and foremost, it may lead to a system of access that is decidedly unequal.  It is highly unlikely that smaller colleges and universities, such as HBCU’s, will ever host RDC’s or even join consortiums.  In my experience, even medium sized regional universities balk at sharing even part of the cost of the RDCs.  Additionally, because funding at RDC’s is always challenging, this presents significant problems for maintaining the system.   Finding appropriate hosts is difficult, and maintaining funding is a challenge.  This will mean some regions, such as western states, will have poor access.  I will also point out that the Census Bureau does not currently have sufficient funds to support a larger RDC system.  The Kentucky Research Data Center has two partner institutions who have been waiting five years for their branch facilities to open.  The main reason for the delay is that Census does not have the personnel or budget to keep up with the current expansion.  In order to address access issues, a much broader expansion will be needed.   Further infrastructure and human resources for disclosure (which is frequently overburdened) and administration of the sites will be paramount.  • The risk that using FSRDC system creates and unfunded mandate. • Additional funds are necessary at the RDC unit level to support this • Additional funds are necessary to allow broad access • Additional funds are necessary at the Census level to provide the infrastructure including  disclosure review, census administrators, and IT environment.  4. The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (See: www.cep.gov) recommended the creation of a National Secure Data Service (See Commission Report at www.cep.gov). Do you agree with this recommendation, and if so, what should be the essential features of a National Secure Data Service?  I would urge the Committee to consider strong recommendations that:  (1) The NSDS be formed with an appropriate budget to: a. Fund Census Administrators throughout the FSRDC system and for an expansion of that  system. b. Fund appropriate personnel for disclosure review c. Fund the costs of expansion (branches/new RDC’s and equipment and personnel).  (2) The NSDS work with FSRDC Executive Directors to identify additional needs for RDC’s including branches, additional Data Centers.  (3) Federal Statistical Agencies reduce or eliminate user fees for access to data or provide funding mechanisms through NSF or other appropriate mechanisms.  (4) Mechanisms for linkages across all data be mandated and facilitated.      Gatton College of  Business and Economics Department of Economics   Christopher R.

How can federal agencies protect individual and organizational privacy when using data for evidence building? Recommend specific actions the Office of Management and Budget and/or other federal agencies can take when using data for evidence building, as well as suggested changes to federal laws, policies, and procedures.  While Title 13 and Title 26 provide a solid basis, the interpretation of these laws needs to be clarified.  In particular there appear to be some who believe any “probability” that an individual could be identified must be driven to zero.  However, this fails to take proper cost benefit into account and taken at it’s extreme, leads to poor estimation (noise injection and “differential privacy”). Indeed, the recent breach of federal IT could be interpreted as implying that no records should ever exist (since they cannot be kept confidential with 100% certainty).  While disclosure risk is certainly important, there are benefits that must be balanced.  Further, the cost of disclosure should be taken into account as well.  Title 13 and title 26 do not allow for this and must be amended.   Currently the Census interprets title 13 to imply that use of restricted data must benefit the Census mission only.  The important benefits of the substantive research should be acknowledged and included in the cost benefit analysis of access to restricted data.   Researchers have long balanced risk and benefit (consider human subjects research protocols).  With the data community the protocol of “Safe People, Safe Projects, Safe Settings, Safe Data, and Safe Outputs” has long been followed, and provided access to restricted data for many.  This is easily expanded and easily implemented, and the FSRDC system is well versed in this.  • Title 13 and Title 26 need to be clarified to acknowledge that some risk of disclosure will always exist, risk and benefit need to be weighed.    • Benefit not only to Census mission or to a specific agency mission. • Protocols exists already for ensuring data safety.  Secure Data Access—  6. If created, how should a data service be structured to best facilitate (1) research and development of secure data access and confidentiality technologies and methods, (2) and agency adoption of those technologies and techniques?  Safe People, Safe Projects, Safe Settings, Safe Data, and Safe Outputs.   This protocol is internationally known and well documented.   The Personal Identification Encryption followed by Census and others is well designed. These issues have long been addressed and there is little need to re-invent the wheel.

Government agencies have argued that secure data access has value because it (1) improves service delivery, (2) improves efficiency (lowers costs), (3) produces metrics for performance measurement, and (4) produces new learnings/insights from the data. Which of these propositions do you agree holds value and why? Do you have examples that demonstrate these benefits? Do you have other examples of the value of secure data access?  I believe all hold true for different projects.  I have the most experience with (4).  Research I’ve been involved in using restricted data has established important relationships between Food Stamp Usage and assets, allowing an understanding of how changing the asset limit would change program take up and predict costs.  I have investigated how survey non-response impacts estimates of poverty, economic inequality, racial wage gaps and gender wage gaps.     Data Services to Federal, State, Local Agencies and the Public—  8. What are the most pressing data needs of state and local decision makers and how would making data accessible from federal agencies help meet those needs? To share data, what guarantees do data owners (or data controllers) need regarding privacy, data stewardship, and retention?  Small geography data on firm and employee relationships.  Federal agencies have myriad data from both surveys and from administrative records that, if linked, would provide deep understanding of how local policies impact economic development.    Safe People, Safe Projects, Safe Settings, Safe Data, and Safe Outputs protocols.   9. What are the key problems and use cases where collaborative work between federal, state, and local authorities' data analysis can inform decisions? What are key decision support tools? How would greater communication about data and tools benefit expanded evidence building?  Small geography data on firm and employee relationships.  Federal agencies have myriad data from both surveys and from administrative records that, if linked, would provide deep understanding of how local policies impact economic development.

What basic public data services are essential for a data service to address existing capacity gaps and needs? What infrastructure or incentives can the federal government create that locals and states cannot?  I would urge the Committee to consider strong recommendations that:  (1) The NSDS be formed with an appropriate budget to: a. Fund Census Administrators throughout the FSRDC system and for an expansion of that  system. b. Fund appropriate personnel for disclosure review c. Fund the costs of expansion (branches/new RDC’s and equipment and personnel).  (2) The NSDS work with FSRDC Executive Directors to identify additional needs for RDC’s including branches, additional Data Centers.  (3) Federal Statistical Agencies reduce or eliminate user fees for access to data or provide funding mechanisms through NSF or other appropriate mechansims.  (4) Mechanisms for linkages across all data be mandated and facilitated.  (5) Partnerships with state and local governments be established to include state and local data  within the FSRDC system.
