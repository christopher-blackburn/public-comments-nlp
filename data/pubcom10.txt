While we are a neutral,mission-driven nonprofit that does not take a position on whether there should be a National SecureData Service, or whether the current student unit record ban should be repealed, we have served asa student-level data network for almost three decades.  In that capacity, we do have a perspective toshare about the structure and function of any education sector portion of such a service thatincludes student-level data, should such a service be created in the future. We are more than happyto share our insights to help the government determine the most efficient and effective roadforward. Overview of the National Student Clearinghouse                 The Clearinghouse is an independent nonprofit organization created by the highereducation community in 1993 that provides a range of data and research-related services to theeducation and workforce communities, including data reporting and exchange, research related toretention, persistence and completion, Title IV compliance reporting to the U.S. Department ofEducation, and degree and enrollment verifications.  Our mission is to serve the education andworkforce communities and all learners with access to trusted data, related services, and insights.                 Our enrollment data, which is reported at least monthly to the Clearinghouse at theprogram level, covers 97% of students enrolled in Title IV eligible degree-granting institutions, andour degree data covers 94% of such students and is reported by major field of study.  This includesall types of students (full-time, part-time, first-time, transfer-in and transfer-out, Title IV aidrecipients, and students receiving no Title IV aid), across all states and sectors of higher education. Thus, we are a comprehensive, student-level data system that serves higher education in vitallyimportant ways and saves colleges and universities more than $750 million each year.  We act in anagency capacity with all institutions that participate.                    We also have a Research Center that works with higher education institutions, states,districts, high schools, and educational organizations to better inform practitioners and policymakersabout student educational pathways. Through accurate longitudinal data outcomes reporting, theResearch Center enables better educational policy decisions, leading to improved studentoutcomes.  This includes our Postsecondary Data Partnership, which provides institutions with richinsights based on a comprehensive set of student data to enable student success. The ResearchCenter recently began publishing a series of reports detailing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemicon education, including its impact on student enrollment, transfer, mobility and progress, whichserve as aids to institutions and policymakers as they work to serve students during this difficulttime.                 You can learn more about our services and research at our websites:https://studentclearinghouse.org (Clearinghouse) and https://nscresearchcenter.org (ResearchCenter). Clearinghouse Data Privacy and Data Security                FERPA applies to Clearinghouse data. As a School Official of institutions of higher education.under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) the Clearinghouse is subject to a robustfederal data privacy regime.  We have worked with institutions to ensure FERPA compliance sinceour founding in 1993.  For example, institutions report to the Clearinghouse those students thathave placed a directory information block on their enrollment and degree records, and we respectthose blocks in our research and verification services. We are a signatory to the Future of PrivacyForum’s Student Privacy Pledge and a supporter of the Data Quality Campaign’s Student DataPrinciples.  You can learn more about our commitment to student data privacy at: https://studentclearinghouse.org/about/our-privacy-commitment.                 The Clearinghouse maintains a robust information security program. The Clearinghousemaintains a comprehensive information security program based on the ISO 27001/27002 standards,staffed by experienced professionals, and backed by comprehensive security policies that detailoperational, management, and technical control requirements that are mapped to widely accepted,industry best practice security standards. This program is regularly reviewed and updated on anannual basis to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness. Clearinghouse Perspective on Questions Presented in the 12/15/20 Federal Register Notice Response to Question 1 What are the main challenges faced by national, state/provincial, or local governments that aretrying to build a basis for evidence-based policy? Briefly describe the bottlenecks and pain-pointsthey face in the evidence-based decision-making process.                The Clearinghouse works with a diverse cross-section of stakeholders in the educationcommunity, including public institutions of higher education, public high schools, school districts,and state agencies. Through this work, we see the bottlenecks and pain points these entities face inarriving at an evidence-based decision-making process. Primary among these is the inability of somany to afford a data infrastructure that enables them to collect, maintain, and use data in aconsistent and effective fashion.  They have a hard time competing for data workforce talent, andsimply do not have the resources to support the latest technology.    Response to Question 4 The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (See: www.cep.gov) recommended the creationof a National Secure Data Service (See Commission Report at www.cep.gov).  Do you agree withthis recommendation, and if so, what should be the essential features of a National Secure DataService?                 While we are neutral on the issues of repealing the ban on a student unit record systemand establishing a National Secure Data Service (“NSDS”), we believe, based on our decades ofexperience,  that any creation of such a service with student-level education records should keep thefollowing points in mind:                 1. Data privacy and security are paramount.  The Clearinghouse’s nonprofit model isbased on institutions voluntarily providing us with data, and if we do not protect student privacy andthe security of student data, our model is not sustainable.  Likewise, for a student-level data networkto maintain long-term viability, protecting the privacy and security of student data should be at thetop of the priority list.  Along these lines an NSDS could be less focused on the collection ofinformation and more focused on establishing secure connected pieces of data that can beleveraged nationally. The Clearinghouse clearly could fit into that schema as it connects to datasystems in all 50 states today with the privacy and security protections discussed above. We providemore on this in point 3 below.                 2. A federal student level data network should provide institutions with access toreports and data they need for increasing student success.  Most postsecondary institutions today,as well as thousands of high schools and districts, use directory level information available throughthe Clearinghouse’s StudentTracker data services in order to better understand the educationalpathways of their students. This information provides important insights for institutionalimprovements that benefit students, such as addressing specific causes of attrition, streamliningtransfer policies, improving student advising, and helping stopped-out students return and completedegrees.  A federal service should allow this same type of value proposition to institutions, inaddition to any transparency or accountability purposes.                  3. The nation has an existing postsecondary data infrastructure, including that of theClearinghouse and state systems.  Policymakers should consider leveraging this infrastructure inany federal student level data network.  This could take many forms as determined bypolicymakers, including the use of the Clearinghouse for institutional data reporting into a federalsystem, for aggregation and reporting of metrics, or through a public private partnership with thefederal government to provide a more complete picture of learner educational pathways into theworkforce. One of the important aspects that the Clearinghouse brings to its current work is todetect and help data providers correct errors coming out of data systems prior to being merged intoa data system. This process can be extended to other forms of data, mitigating the opportunity fordata irregularities and providing a normalized data set for evaluation across state lines.                  4. There are certain artifacts that federal agencies will not be able to include in a federalstudent level data network, but which are increasingly important to the policy goals ofinstitutional transparency and accountability.  Learners are preparing for the workforce throughnon-credit coursework that leads to industry-issued credentials, not just through traditional credit-bearing work that results in a degree. Any system that purports to provide insight into institutionalperformance and learner pathways should allow institutions to provide insights in this area as well.   The fast-evolving nature of micro-credentials and non-traditional forms of education provided bytraditional education entities creates the prospect of an incomplete set of data regarding howinstitutions contribute to the education and workforce trajectory of learners.  This providesmisleading information, or at a minimum incomplete information, which could lead to an incompletenarrative. More on this below.                 5. Evolve at the accelerating pace of educational innovation in support of diversestudent populations.  The world of education and workforce preparation is changing rapidly, withnon-traditional approaches to training (like certifications and non-credit coursework) serving bothtraditional and non-traditional student populations.  The education data portion of an NSDS shouldcontinually evolve to meet the changes faced by the stakeholders it serves. The major challenge hereis that there are few national standards around the data content, descriptors, frequency ofcollection, or the quality of these credentials, although there are efforts underway to try to codifythese. The world of micro-credentials and the gig economy present large challenges in ensuring thatthe learning and the outcome are in fact of quality. This presents measurement challenges. Leadingedge institutions that are supporting learners could be disproportionately impacted by policies thathave not evolved to the point where they can support these new learning outcomes, such as 21stCentury skills being included in the learning outcomes of a leaner’s journey. Response to Question 5 How can federal agencies protect individual and organizational privacy when using data forevidence building? Recommend specific actions the Office of Management and Budget and/orother federal agencies can take when using data for evidence building, as well as suggestedchanges to federal laws, policies, and procedures.                 A National Secure Data Service should provide transparency to data subjects about the datathat is held on them, the uses to which that data is put, and their rights with respect to that data.Third-party access to data must ensure that FERPA, COPPA, HIPPA, and other related dataprotections are in force, and require that the level of security and transparency required under theFuture of Privacy Forum work highlighted above be met. Response to Question 7 Government agencies have argued that secure data access has value because it (1) improvesservice delivery, (2) improves efficiency (lowers costs), (3) produces metrics for performancemeasurement, and (4) produces new learnings/insights from the data. Which of thesepropositions do you agree holds value and why? Do you have examples that demonstrate thesebenefits? Do you have other examples of the value of secure data access?                 A National Secure Data Service will produce value to the extent its purposes are made clear.With respect to the education-related data such a service would hold, the federal governmentshould clearly articulate, in consultation with institutions that provide education data, the purposesof the NSDS and what questions it will be expected to answer. The federal government should alsokeep in mind that some successful data sharing initiatives require certain types of data, e.g., currentdata or longitudinal data.  If certain research needs cannot be met with the type of data the NSDSleverages, those shortcomings should be made clear.                 Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how internet access and technology access isseverely lacking for the most at-risk populations. This needs to be addressed, otherwise an NSDA willonly provide value to the elite. Within the education community, the Clearinghouse has seen howthe least resourced institutions are often also the ones dealing with the students who have the leastresources.  Response to Question 8 What are the most pressing data needs of state and local decision makers and how would   making data accessible from federal agencies help meet those needs? To share data, whatguarantees do data owners (or data controllers) need regarding privacy, data stewardship, andretention?                Data owners need to be assured that their data will be maintained accurately and securely,and be governed by a “do no harm” mindset. There need to be policies governed by FERPA andrelated data governance rules, including very precise account management processes that lay out atevery level what data can be seen by whom, as well as the rules that differentiate betweenindividually identifiable data and data sets that are in aggregate while ensuring comparability. TheClearinghouse performs this function today with Gear-Up and other national initiatives.
