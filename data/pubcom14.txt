February 9, 2021  Data Quality Campaign Comments to Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building.    The Data Quality Campaign (DQC) appreciates the opportunity to respond to questions posed by the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building to address state challenges and needs. DQC is a policy and advocacy organization committed to ensuring that education stakeholders have access to and can use meaningful, high-quality data in support of students. We believe that the federal government plays an important role in creating the conditions that will enable states to modernize their infrastructure and explore innovative approaches to analyzing and using data to generate insights that result in better services to individuals. Below, you will find our responses to questions 8 and 9.   Question 8. What are the most pressing data needs of state and local decision makers and how would making data accessible from federal agencies help meet those needs? To share data, what guarantees do data owners (or data controllers) need regarding privacy, data stewardship, and retention?   States are currently struggling to meet pressing information demands that their data “ecosystems” are not equipped to handle. They need to upgrade their technical infrastructure, and also increase their capacity to analyze and use their data. With looming budget shortfalls, they will need federal support to address these challenges. Among other things, they need:   A rapid infusion of funds to comply with new federal reporting requirements, inform learning recovery through rapid research projects, and make upgrades to systems and tools to address their most immediate new information needs.   Significant investments in their data infrastructure to modernize outdated systems, link and share data across agencies, make more data sets “open”, and create new analytic tools and dashboards to get stakeholder the insights they need.   Support for research partnerships and streamlined processes for providing researchers with access to data to increase state and local agency capacity to build evidence and make research informed policy decisions.   Staff imbedded in state and local agencies with the skills to nimbly navigate available data and provide findings in an easily consumable manner.   Technical assistance and resources related to safeguarding data to ease the burden of responding to questions, complying with state and federal requirements, and training others on their responsibilities related to data privacy and security.

What are the key problems and use cases where collaborative work between federal, state, and local authorities' data analysis can inform decisions? What are key decision support tools? How would greater communication about data and tools benefit expanded evidence building?  State and local data staff tend to be stretched in many directions, with the same people trying to meet internal agency needs, federal compliance requirements, and external requests. To ease these challenges, they need:   Clear and prompt information from the federal government about expectations for new reporting requirements.  Efforts to reduce reporting burden, when data collections are no longer needed or can be gathered through a  different source.  Consistency in definitions so they do not need to collect similar things differently depending on the source of the  request.  Opportunities to provide input on new data collections or other new initiatives so that they can share what they  already have and can do, and those opportunities and limitations are considered in any new federal actions.  State and local leaders have limited time and many policy issues requiring insights. To get value from their data infrastructure they need:   Information presented in a manner that is easy to consume and that facilitates decision-making.  Insights that a require linking information across agencies (e.g., high school feedback reports that provide  information about choices individuals make after high school).  Systems nimble enough to adjust to collect new information or provide new reports as priorities change.
